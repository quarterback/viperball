## After-Action Review — February 24, 2026

### Objectives
Add endgame clock management mechanics and fix snap kick range enforcement.

---

### What We Did

**1. Victory Formation (Kneel-Down)**
- Added a new play type that lets a leading team run out the clock in Q4. Burns 35-40 seconds per play, loses 1-2 yards — just like a real kneel-down.
- Triggers when leading by more than 5 with under 90 seconds left, or any lead under 45 seconds.
- Result: Averaging 1.6 kneels per game. Eliminates the old problem where teams would awkwardly punt or run normal plays when they should be milking clock.

**2. Defensive Timeout Strategy**
- Trailing defenses now call timeouts in Q4 when under 3 minutes and within 14 points — forcing the offense to actually run plays instead of just bleeding clock.
- Probability scales with urgency (less time = more aggressive) and deficit size (closer game = more likely to call TO). Coaching awareness modifies the likelihood.

**3. Snap Kick Range Fix (58-Yard Hard Cap)**
- Discovered the old 0.001 weight floor was allowing rare snap kick selections beyond 58 yards. Replaced with a true hard-zero system.
- Enforced the 58-yard cutoff *after* all modifiers (boot raid bonuses, take-points bias, etc.) so nothing can sneak past.
- Fixed the clock-management "final play" path to check actual kicker range instead of a raw field-position threshold.

### Key Findings

- **False positive investigation**: What initially looked like 60-84 yard DK attempts were actually normal-range kicks (32-55 yards) that got blocked. The play log was recording the *defense's recovery position*, not where the kick was attempted from. No code change needed — it's correct behavior, just misleading if you measure from the post-play field position.
- **Clock-aware play selection** (suppressing kicks when leading, boosting when trailing) was already handled by the existing 3-minute warning code. No new work needed there.

### Validation (50-Game Test Suite)

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| DK attempts >58 yards | **0** (hard zero) |
| Max actual DK distance | 56 yards |
| Avg DK distance | 34.2 yards |
| DK attempts per game | 3.9 |
| Kneels per game | 1.6 |
| Avg points per team | 64.0 |
| Score range | 29-96 |

---

### What Went Well
- Victory formation and defensive timeouts integrated cleanly without disrupting existing play selection or scoring balance.
- The false positive investigation saved us from an unnecessary "fix" that would have broken legitimate blocked kick recording.

### What to Watch
- Kneel/timeout frequency across different team archetypes in longer dynasty sims — may want to tune thresholds if edge cases appear.
- Test telemetry should always measure snap kick distance from the *pre-kick* field position to avoid the blocked-kick false positive issue again.
