# How to Talk About Viperball

A guide for sports writers, commentators, and anyone covering the Collegiate Viperball League.

## Why This Document Exists

Viperball is not football with tweaks. It is its own sport with its own rhythms, its own heroes, its own vocabulary, and its own idea of what makes a game exciting. Writers who default to football framing — "it's like the NFL but without forward passes" — will miss the texture entirely. This guide teaches you what to look for, what to celebrate, and how to write about it authentically.

## The Feel of a Game

A Viperball game feels like a basketball game played on grass.

The scoring is continuous. Points come from everywhere — a snap kick here, a pindown there, a fumble recovery bell, a grinding touchdown drive. There are no long stretches of scoreless football. The scoreboard is always moving. A team can score 3 points on a field goal, get a pindown on the ensuing punt (1 point), force a fumble on the opponent's first play (0.5-point bell), and then kick a snap kick (5 points) — all within two minutes.

The pace is relentless. Drives are longer than in American football because teams have six downs, but the number of scoring channels means the scoreboard updates constantly. A "defensive struggle" in Viperball might end 34-28. A shootout might end 78-63.

The chaos is real. Lateral chains can break open or break down on any play. A 4-lateral chain that produces a 30-yard gain is exhilarating. The same chain with a fumble on the third exchange is devastating. Every touch of the ball is a potential turning point.

The kicking is beautiful. A perfectly struck snap kick from 42 yards — the ball dropped, the bounce, the swing, the flight through the uprights — is one of the most aesthetically satisfying plays in sports. It happens 4-5 times per team per game. It never gets old.

## What Makes Games Exciting

### 1. The Kick-or-Drive Decision

The defining strategic moment of Viperball happens roughly at the opponent's 40-yard line. Your Zeroback has the ball. She's in snap kick range. Does she take the 5 points right now, or does the team push for a 9-point touchdown?

This is the equivalent of basketball's "do we take the three or drive to the basket?" It happens multiple times per game, and the answer changes based on score, time, down, wind, the kicker's accuracy, and how tired the defense looks. Great games are built on these decisions.

Write about this tension. It is the heartbeat of the sport.

### 2. Lateral Chain Drama

A 4-lateral chain is a high-wire act. The ball leaves the Zeroback's hands, hits the Wingback at full sprint, swings to the Viper cutting against the grain, and then flips to the Halfback on the edge — and the whole time, every handoff could be a fumble. When it works, it's breathtaking. When it doesn't, it's a live ball on the ground with ten players diving for it.

The best chains don't just gain yards. They shift the entire geometry of the defense. A team that runs a successful 3-lateral chain on first down has announced to the stadium that they're willing to risk everything, and the defense has to respect that the rest of the drive.

### 3. The Pindown War

In games between two territorial-minded teams, the punt becomes a weapon. Each team tries to pin the other deep. Each pindown is worth a point, and the cumulative effect — 5 or 6 pindowns in a game — can be the margin of victory in a close contest.

Pindown wars are quieter than shootouts, but they have their own intensity. A perfectly placed punt that dies at the 3-yard line is a moment worth writing about. The receiving team starting a drive from their own 4, with 96 yards to go and six downs to gain 20, is a suffocating position.

### 4. Weather Chaos

Rain games and snow games transform Viperball. When the ball is wet, snap kicks become unreliable, laterals become treacherous, and the ground game becomes the only safe option. These games produce wildly different box scores — fewer kick pass completions, more fumbles, more bells, more grinding. A sleet game might end 31-24 with eight combined fumbles and a dozen bells.

Weather games reward different kinds of teams. A Chain Gang team that thrives in dry conditions can be neutralized by rain. A Ground & Pound team that struggles in shootouts becomes dominant when the footing is bad.

### 5. The Return Touchdown

A punt returned for a touchdown is worth 9 points, and it comes out of nowhere. A missed snap kick that gets fielded and returned 85 yards for a score is one of the most momentum-shifting plays in any sport. Return touchdowns are not common, but they are not rare either — a fast Keeper with open space and two good blocks can change a game in eight seconds.

## The Five Game Archetypes

Not all Viperball games feel the same. Recognizing the archetype helps you frame your coverage.

### The Shootout (70+ combined points)

Both offenses are humming. Snap kicks are falling. Lateral chains are connecting. Drives are ending in scores. Neither defense can get a stop, and neither team wants to punt.

**What to write about:** The duel between the two Zerobacks. Which one blinks first? Which one makes the big kick when it matters? The offensive rhythm and the inability of either defense to adjust.

**Language:** "traded haymakers," "offensive clinic," "the scoreboard couldn't keep up"

### The Defensive Grind (sub-40 combined points)

Both defenses are dominant. Drives stall. Snap kicks are blocked or missed. Turnovers are the primary scoring method. The team that makes fewer mistakes wins.

**What to write about:** The defensive stars — the DL player who had 3 sacks, the Keeper who made a game-saving tackle. The turnovers and the field position battle. Every point feels earned.

**Language:** "suffocating," "bend-don't-break," "every yard was contested"

### The Kicking Duel (high snap kick volume, few TDs)

Both teams are content to trade snap kicks and field goals. Neither team can sustain a drive long enough for a touchdown, but both have kickers who can score from 40 yards. The game becomes a contest of kicking accuracy and field position.

**What to write about:** The kickers. Their accuracy under pressure, their range, their footwork. The strategic decision of when to kick versus when to push for more.

**Language:** "the boot decided it," "range war," "she put her foot through it from 47"

### The Chaos Game (high turnovers, swings in momentum)

Neither team can hold on to the ball. Lateral fumbles, muffed punts, kick pass interceptions — turnovers fly in every direction. The lead changes constantly. Bells pile up. The game is decided by who recovers the last loose ball.

**What to write about:** The momentum swings. The crowd noise. The specific fumbles that changed everything. The bell count (which might reach 8-10 in a chaotic game).

**Language:** "carnival," "the ball had a mind of its own," "seven lead changes"

### The Upset

A heavily favored team goes down. The underdog's defense creates turnovers, their kicker hits the snap kick of her life from 49 yards, and their ground game grinds out clock in the fourth quarter.

**What to write about:** The moment you knew. The play that changed everything. The individual performance that made the upset possible. The favored team's inability to adjust.

**Language:** "statement win," "nobody told them they couldn't," "the biggest kick of her career"

## Offensive Identity and Style

Every CVL team runs a named offensive scheme. The scheme defines how the team moves the ball, what plays they prefer, and what the box score will look like. Understanding a team's scheme is essential to writing about them.

### Ground & Pound
**Identity:** Power running. Old-school, deliberate football. Use all six downs to grind 20 yards, punch it in.
**Box score signature:** High carries (25+), high rush yards (140+), low kick pass attempts, few laterals.
**The player to watch:** The lead Zeroback. She will carry the ball 18-25 times and her YPC tells the whole story.
**Write it like:** A heavyweight fight. Slow, physical, inevitable.

### Boot Raid
**Identity:** Air Raid with the foot. Get to the "launch pad" (the opponent's 40-45), then fire snap kicks. The kick pass is the primary weapon; the snap kick is the finishing blow.
**Box score signature:** High kick pass attempts (20+), 55%+ completion rate, 5+ snap kick attempts, moderate rushing.
**The player to watch:** The Kicking ZB. She is an artist with her foot, and the game revolves around getting her into range.
**Write it like:** An artillery battery. Set up, aim, fire.

### Chain Gang
**Identity:** Maximum laterals, maximum chaos. Every play is a 4-5 lateral chain. Showtime Viperball.
**Box score signature:** 15+ lateral chains, 65%+ chain efficiency, distributed touches, high fumble count (accepted risk).
**The player to watch:** Whoever catches the last lateral in the chain — the Flanker who turns upfield after three exchanges.
**Write it like:** A jazz ensemble. Improvised, collaborative, thrilling when it works, painful when it doesn't.

### Lateral Spread
**Identity:** Stretch the defense horizontally with multi-lateral chains. Similar to Chain Gang but more controlled — chains are shorter (2-3 laterals) and more deliberate.
**Box score signature:** Moderate chain count, high lateral efficiency, balanced rushing and kick passing.
**The player to watch:** The Viper. She is the chain target — the player who receives the lateral in space and turns it into yards.
**Write it like:** A zone-read spread offense. Disciplined, spatial, methodical.

### Ghost Formation
**Identity:** Viper chaos and pre-snap confusion. The defense never knows where the playmaker is. Misdirection and motion on every play.
**Box score signature:** Balanced across all categories but unpredictable. High trick play count. Moderate kick pass and lateral numbers.
**The player to watch:** The Viper, who might line up in 6 different positions across 6 plays.
**Write it like:** A magic show. Sleight of hand. "Where did she come from?"

### Rouge Hunt
**Identity:** Defense-first offense. Punt early, pin deep, force mistakes. Score pindowns, bells, and safeties.
**Box score signature:** High punt count, 4+ pindowns, low offensive yards, low snap kick attempts. The offense exists to serve the defense.
**The player to watch:** The punter. In Rouge Hunt, the punter is the most important offensive player.
**Write it like:** A chess match. Territorial control. "They won the field position battle decisively."

### Ball Control
**Identity:** Conservative, mistake-free football. Take the points when available. Win 24-21.
**Box score signature:** Moderate everywhere. Low turnovers. High snap kick percentage. Controlled clock.
**The player to watch:** The Dual-Threat ZB who doesn't make mistakes. She won't have a highlight reel, but she won't give you anything either.
**Write it like:** A clinic. Professional. "They played their game and dared you to beat them."

### Triple Threat
**Identity:** Single-wing misdirection. Power Flankers take direct snaps. Nobody knows who has the ball.
**Box score signature:** Distributed rushing numbers. Multiple players with 5+ carries. High trick play count. Moderate kick pass.
**The player to watch:** The Power Flanker who takes direct snaps. She is a fullback who can throw (lateral) and kick.
**Write it like:** Vintage football. Throwback. "It looked like something from 1925, and it worked in 2026."

### Balanced
**Identity:** No strong tendency, adapts to situation. Multiple threats, adaptable gameplan.
**Box score signature:** Nothing stands out. Everything is moderate. The offense takes what the defense gives.
**The player to watch:** The Dual-Threat ZB. She does a little of everything and the defense can never commit.
**Write it like:** A team that is comfortable everywhere and dominant nowhere.

## How to Read a Box Score

A Viperball box score is structured in six sections. Here's what each one tells you:

### 1. Style Fingerprint (Header)
Before any numbers, the header shows each team's offensive scheme and tempo:
```
Agnes Scott — Ground & Pound | Slow
Air Force — Boot Raid | Mid
```
This tells you immediately what kind of game it was. You can predict the box score before reading it.

### 2. Rushing
**Carries, Yards, YPC, Rush TDs.** The ground game. In Ground & Pound, this is the headliner. In Boot Raid, it's the supporting act. If a team has 30+ carries and 150+ rush yards, they controlled the ball.

### 3. Kick Passing
**Attempts, Completions, Comp%, Yards, TDs, INTs.** The aerial game. 20+ attempts means the team was kick-passing frequently. A 65% completion rate is excellent. A 45% completion rate means the defense was disrupting the kicking game.

### 4. Lateral Game
**Chains, Successful, Efficiency, Yards, Lat INTs.** Viperball's unique dimension. A Chain Gang team should show 15+ chains. A Ground & Pound team might show 5-8. Efficiency above 65% means the chains were working. Below 50% means they were costly.

### 5. Kicking
**Snap Kicks (made/att), Field Goals (made/att), Punts.** This section reveals the kicking philosophy. A Boot Raid team might show 6/8 on snap kicks. A Ground & Pound team might show 2/3. High punt counts suggest a Rouge Hunt approach.

### 6. Team Totals
**Total yards, yds/play, total plays, fumbles, bonus possessions, penalties.** The bottom-line summary. If a team ran 85+ plays, they controlled tempo. If they had 4+ fumbles, they were careless. If they had bonus possessions (turnovers), the defense was creating opportunities.

### The Three-Second Test
Glance at the style header, then check the one section that matters most for that style:
- Ground & Pound → Rushing
- Boot Raid → Kick Passing + Kicking
- Chain Gang → Lateral Game
- Rouge Hunt → Kicking (punt count + pindowns)

If the numbers match the style, the team executed its identity. If they don't, something happened — maybe the weather changed the game, or the defense forced them off-script.

## The Star Player Archetypes

### The Kicking ZB: The Sniper
She doesn't run much. She doesn't need to. Her job is to reach the opponent's 40-yard line and fire a snap kick through the uprights. When she's on, she'll hit 5 of 6 from range and the opponent is chasing 25 points of kicking alone.

**Write about her like:** A shooter. A closer. "She dropped it, the bounce was clean, and the ball split the uprights from 44 yards — her fourth of the day."

### The Running ZB: The Workhorse
She carries the ball 20 times and runs for 130 yards. She converts on 5th-and-6 by lowering her shoulder. She scores touchdowns. She is the reason the defense stacks the box, which opens everything else.

**Write about her like:** A running back. An engine. "She took the handoff for the 22nd time, broke a tackle at the line, and didn't go down until she'd crossed the first-down marker."

### The Viper: The X-Factor
She lines up on the left hash, shifts right, goes in motion across the formation, and by the time the ball is snapped, two defenders are following her and a Flanker is uncovered. When she actually gets the ball, she's electric in space.

**Write about her like:** A weapon. A chess piece. "She touched the ball three times and gained 67 yards. She didn't touch it on six other plays and still created 40 yards of separation for her teammates."

### The Diving Wing: The Specialist
She might touch the ball once all game on offense. But on defense, she's the player the opposing kicker is worried about. She times the release, dives at the ball, and when she gets a hand on a snap kick, the stadium explodes.

**Write about her like:** A role player who becomes the hero. "She played 14 snaps on offense and gained 8 yards. But her blocked snap kick in the third quarter — her team's only blocked kick all season — was the play of the game."

### The Keeper: The Last Line
She patrols the deep field. When a snap kick misses, she fields it. When a runner breaks through the defense, she's the one who makes the tackle at the 5-yard line. She's also the kick returner, which means she might be the one taking a missed field goal 80 yards the other way for a touchdown.

**Write about her like:** A safety and a punt returner combined. "She fielded the missed snap kick at her own 12, cut left past the first wave, and didn't stop until she reached the opposing 34 — a 54-yard return that flipped the field."

## The Signature Plays

These are the plays that define Viperball. Learn to recognize and celebrate them.

### The Snap Kick from Range
A 42-yard drop kick through the uprights. The crowd holds its breath during the drop, the bounce, the swing of the leg. When the ball clears the crossbar, it's 5 points and a roar.

### The Lateral Chain Touchdown
A play where the ball passes through 3 or 4 sets of hands before someone scores. The crowd tracks the ball — ZB to Wingback to Viper to Halfback — and each lateral draws a gasp. When the last player crosses the goal line, the celebration includes everyone who touched the ball.

### The Pindown Punt
A punt that rolls dead at the 3-yard line. The kicking team earns a point and the receiving team faces a 97-yard field. It's not flashy, but it's devastating.

### The Blocked Snap Kick
A Diving Wing times the kicker's release, dives, and gets a hand on the ball. The blocked kick bounces loose — both teams scramble. If the defense recovers, it's a bell and a turnover. If the defense returns it for a touchdown, the game might be over.

### The Kick Pass Bomb
A 35-yard kick pass that the receiver catches in stride, shakes one tackler, and takes another 20 yards after the catch. Kick pass completions produce more yards after catch than any play in the sport because receivers catch the ball in open space.

### The Fumble Scrum
A lateral goes to the ground. Six players from both teams converge. Bodies pile up. The referee signals who recovered. The recovering team gets 0.5 points (bell) plus the ball. These scrambles are pure chaos and the crowd is on its feet every time.

---

## The Small Scores That Win Games

One of the most interesting aspects of Viperball is that the small scores — pindowns and bells — accumulate to meaningful totals. In a game decided by 3 points, a team's pindown and bell total is often the difference.

### Tracking the Margins

In a close game, track these:
- **Pindowns:** Each is 1 point. A team that earns 5 pindowns has 5 free points from field position dominance.
- **Bells:** Each is 0.5 points. A team that recovers 6 loose balls has 3 free points from hustle and opportunism.
- **Combined:** A team with 5 pindowns and 6 bells has added **8 points** without scoring a single touchdown, snap kick, or field goal.

When writing about close games, always check the pindown and bell totals. They tell you who controlled field position (pindowns) and who won the hustle plays (bells).

### The Rouge Hunt Special

A Rouge Hunt team that wins 28-25 might have scored like this:
- 1 touchdown: 9 points
- 2 snap kicks: 10 points
- 1 safety: 2 points
- 5 pindowns: 5 points
- 4 bells: 2 points

That's 28 points. Seven of those points came from pindowns and bells alone. The team scored 1 touchdown in the entire game and still won. This is legitimate, beautiful, strategic Viperball — not a fluke. Write about it with respect.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Don't call it "football without passing"
Viperball has an aerial game — the kick pass. Calling it "no-pass football" erases the 40+ kick pass attempts per team per game. Say "no forward pass" if you must clarify, but the game has plenty of balls in the air.

### 2. Don't ignore the small scores
A writer who only reports touchdowns and snap kicks is missing the story. Pindowns and bells are legitimate scoring channels that teams actively pursue. They are not consolation prizes.

### 3. Don't treat laterals as gimmicks
Lateral chains are not trick plays. They are a fundamental part of the offensive toolkit, as basic as running plays. Chain Gang and Lateral Spread teams run laterals on 30-40% of plays. Treat them like you'd treat a passing game in the NFL — core strategy, not novelty.

### 4. Don't compare the Zeroback to a quarterback
The Zeroback is a completely different position. A quarterback throws. A Zeroback runs, kicks, and distributes through laterals. The closest comparison is a rugby fly-half or an Australian Rules midfielder — someone who does everything. Calling her a QB flattens her role.

### 5. Don't forget the Viper
The Viper is the most unique position in the sport. She can line up anywhere, move before the snap, and create mismatches that don't exist in any other gridiron code. If you write a game recap and don't mention what the Viper did (or what her presence created for others), you've missed a dimension.

### 6. Don't assume a high score means bad defense
Viperball games routinely produce scores of 50+ per side. This doesn't mean the defenses are bad. The sport has six scoring channels and offenses have six downs. A defense that holds the opponent to 45 points is having a good day. A defense that holds them to 35 is dominant.

### 7. Don't forget the weather
Weather transforms Viperball more than any other gridiron sport. A rain game is a completely different sport than a clear-sky game. Always mention the conditions if they were anything other than clear. "She hit a snap kick from 44 in the rain" means something very different than "She hit a snap kick from 44."

## Game Recap Templates

### Quick Recap (3-4 sentences)

> [Team A] defeated [Team B] [score] behind [star player]'s [key stat line]. [Team A] scored [X] snap kicks and [Y] touchdowns while holding [Team B] to [key defensive stat]. The [decisive moment/play] in the [quarter] sealed it. [Weather/context note if applicable].

**Example:**
> Piedmont defeated Agnes Scott 57-42 behind Zeroback Danielle Torres's 5-for-7 snap kick performance. Piedmont scored 5 snap kicks and 2 touchdowns while forcing 4 turnovers. Torres's 49-yard snap kick midway through the fourth quarter pushed the lead to three possessions. The win moves Piedmont to 6-2 in conference play.

### Feature Recap (full column)

Open with the decisive moment. Describe the play in detail — who had the ball, what happened, what it meant. Then zoom out to the game narrative: how did we get here? What was the style matchup? Who controlled the scoring channels?

Cover the kicking stats prominently. Mention the pindown and bell totals if they were a factor. Name the Viper and describe what she created. Close with what it means for the standings.

### Upset Recap

Open with the final score and the shock factor. Then identify the three things the underdog did that the favorite didn't expect. One of them is almost always kicking — either a kicker who was hotter than usual or a defense that blocked kicks. Close with the moment the favorite realized they were in trouble.

## A Final Note

Viperball is a women's sport with its own history, strategy, and culture. It is not a minor-league version of men's football. It is not a novelty. The athletes are elite, the strategy is deep, the games are dramatic, and the scoring system produces results that reward intelligence and versatility as much as raw athleticism.

Write about it like you'd write about any sport you love — with specificity, respect, and an eye for the moments that matter.
