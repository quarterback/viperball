# Viperball: Playbook Development Baseline

**Purpose:** This document gives you everything you need to design new offensive and defensive philosophies for Viperball. Read the whole thing before proposing anything. You are a sport designer, not an explainer — treat the sport as real, established, and fully operational. Your job is to expand its tactical vocabulary.

---

## Part 1: The Sport

### Core Identity

Viperball is a full-contact women's collegiate field sport played on a 100-yard field, 11v11. It evolved from a timeline where the forward pass never became dominant — kicking remained central, players stayed versatile, and football developed around space, stamina, and field position rather than aerial quarterbacking.

**The forward pass does not exist.** Any forward throw is a dead ball + penalty. The ball moves via runs, laterals (backward/sideways passes), and kick passes (kicking the ball downfield to a teammate).

### Downs and Possession

- **6 downs to gain 20 yards** for a new set of downs
- Failure after 6 downs = turnover at the spot
- **4th down is a coaching decision point:** go for advancement (downs 4-6 remain live) or enter **Kick Mode** (commit to kicking plays on downs 5-6)
- Drives have three phases: Advancement (downs 1-3), Decision (down 4), Specialist (downs 5-6 in Kick Mode)

### Scoring

| Score | Points | How |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Touchdown** | 9 | Ball crosses goal line on a run or lateral play |
| **Snap Kick** | 5 | Drop kick through the uprights (can be attempted on any down) |
| **Place Kick (Field Goal)** | 3 | Traditional set-piece kick through the uprights |
| **Safety** | 2 | Defense tackles the ball carrier in their own end zone |
| **Pindown (Rouge)** | 1 | A kick reaches the end zone and isn't returned |
| **Bell** | ½ | Recovering an opponent's loose ball (fumble, blocked kick, deflection) |

No conversion attempts after touchdowns. Half-point scoring means final scores routinely include halves (47½ to 38).

### The Sacrifice System

When a team scores, the *opposing* team's next drive starts with a field position penalty proportional to the lead. If you're leading by 14, your next drive after the opponent scores starts at your own 20 minus the lead differential. Leads become liabilities. This is the sport's core comeback mechanic — the bigger your lead, the worse your field position on the next possession.

### The Pesäpallo Rule

Missed snap kick attempts retain possession. The ball is dead at the line of scrimmage and the down advances. This means snap kicks are never "wasted possessions" — you take the shot, and if you miss, you still have the ball. This fundamentally changes risk calculus for kicking offenses.

### Bonus Possession (Defensive Pesäpallo)

When a team throws an interception (kick pass or lateral), the intercepted team gets a **bonus possession** after the intercepting team's next drive. The bonus drive starts from the intercepted team's own 25-yard line. Cancels if the intercepting team also throws an INT, or if the half expires.

## Part 2: Positions

### Offensive 11

| Position | Count | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Linemen** (LT, LG, C, RG, RT) | 5 | Blocking foundation. May advance, lateral, receive laterals, and kick once ball is live. Eligible to recover all live balls. |
| **Zeroback (ZB)** | 1 | Primary distributor. Receives snap. Can run, lateral, or kick at any time. The field general — equivalent to a quarterback but without the forward pass. |
| **Halfback (HB)** | 1 | Primary ball carrier. Receives handoffs, laterals, kicks. Can kick in open play. |
| **Wingbacks (LW, RW)** | 2 | Perimeter players. Must align outside interior formation. Block, run, receive laterals/kicks. |
| **Shiftback (SB)** | 1 | Hybrid. Aligns between interior and perimeter. May shift position pre-snap. Creates unpredictability. |
| **Viper (V)** | 1 | Wild card. Alignment-exempt — can line up anywhere on the field. Wears a distinctly different colored jersey. Tactical chameleon: deep target, motion decoy, surprise rusher. |

**Key rule:** All positional restrictions apply only at the snap. Once the ball is live, every player can do everything — run, lateral, kick, block, recover loose balls.

### Defensive 11

| Position | Count | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Line Anchors** (LG, Nose, RG) | 3 | Must align within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage. Interior pressure, run stuffing. |
| **Edge Defenders** | 2 | Outside the Line Anchors. Edge containment, pursuit, pass rush. |
| **Spotbacks** | 2 | Behind the primary line. Gap fill, pursuit, intermediate coverage. |
| **Cornerbacks** | 2 | Wide coverage. Defend sweeps, outside runs, kick pass targets. |
| **Lastback** | 1 | Deep secondary. Run support, coverage against deep plays. |
| **Keeper** | 1 | Deepest defender. Fields missed field goals, last line of defense, can deflect snap kick attempts for Bells. |

**Keeper archetypes:** Return Keeper (turns deep kicks into scoring chances), Sure-Hands Keeper (never muffs a catch), Deflection Keeper (tips snap kicks for Bell opportunities).

## Part 3: The Three Pillars of Offense

Viperball offense operates on a triangle:

**Running → Kick Passing → Snap Kicks**

Teams run to set up the kick pass. They kick pass to stretch the field. When they're in range, they go for the snap kick (the premium score). Everything flows between these three.

### Pillar 1: The Run Game

The foundation. Seven run play families, each with distinct risk/reward:

| Play Family | Base Yards | Fumble Rate | Character |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Dive Option** | 7.5–9.5 | 1.8% | Safe, consistent, bread-and-butter |
| **Power** | 8.0–10.0 | 2.0% | Physical, between the tackles |
| **Sweep Option** | 8.5–11.5 | 2.4% | Wide, high ceiling |
| **Speed Option** | 9.0–12.5 | 2.4% | Explosive, risky |
| **Counter** | 8.0–12.0 | 2.2% | Misdirection, high variance |
| **Draw** | 8.5–12.5 | 2.0% | Delayed handoff, breaks containment |
| **Viper Jet** | 10.0–14.0 | 3.0% | Highest ceiling, highest risk. Jet sweep to the Viper. |

**Breakaway system:** Any run gaining 5+ yards has a chance to trigger a breakaway (additional 15–85 yards). The chance scales by play family — Viper Jet has 30% explosive chance, Dive Option has 14%.

**Carrier selection** is archetype-driven. A Ground & Pound team feeds the Halfback on dives and powers. A Ghost team sends the Viper on jets and counters.

### Pillar 2: The Kick Pass

The passing game of Viperball. A kick pass is exactly what it sounds like — the Zeroback (or another player) drop kicks the ball downfield to a teammate. Think rugby kick-pass or Aussie rules drop punt to a lead runner.

**Four sub-families:**

| Sub-Family | Range | Completion Rate | Character |
|------------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| **Quick Kick** | 5–12 yards | ~75% | Screen pass equivalent. Safe, short, possession play. |
| **Territory** | 13–25 yards | ~63% | Medium range. The workhorse. Moves the chains. |
| **Bomb** | 26–45 yards | ~40% | Deep shot. High risk, high reward. House-call potential on catch-and-run. |
| **Kick-Lateral** | Varies | ~60% | Kick pass to a receiver who immediately pitches into a lateral chain. Hybrid play. |

**Sack vulnerability** depends on formation protection count and release time. A Bomb from Spread formation (5 protection, 1.4 release time) has ~14% sack rate. A Quick Kick from Heavy (7 protection, 0.6 release time) has ~1%.

**Interception rate:** ~5% globally on kick passes. INT returns average 50–80 yards with genuine pick-six threat.

### Pillar 3: The Snap Kick

The marquee scoring play. A drop kick through the uprights, worth 5 points. Can be attempted on any down from anywhere on the field. The Pesäpallo rule (missed attempts retain possession) makes these low-risk relative to their reward.

Accuracy drops with distance. A kicker with 85+ rating hitting from 30–35 yards is like a shooter draining threes. From 50+, it's a prayer — but it's a free prayer because you keep the ball if you miss.

**Place kicks (field goals)** are the conservative option — 3 points, higher accuracy, but must be taken from scrimmage as a set piece.

### The Lateral

Laterals are spice, not the main course. Any backward or sideways pass that remains live if it hits the ground. A lateral chain is when the ball passes through multiple sets of hands on a single play.

**Risk profile per lateral:**
- Fumble: 12% base + 5% per additional lateral in the chain
- Interception: 3% per lateral
- Yardage: gauss(0.8, 1.0) + 0.4 yards per lateral in the chain

A 4-lateral chain faces roughly 23% total turnover risk. When it works, it's a highlight reel. When it doesn't, it's a Bell for the other team.

---

## Part 4: Formation Shells

Four formation shells modify every play's characteristics:

| Formation | Identity | Protection | Kick Pass Modifier | Lateral Modifier |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Tight** | Compact, balanced | 6 blockers | Baseline | Baseline |
| **Split** | Standard spread | 5.5 blockers | Slight boost | Slight boost |
| **Spread** | Wide, receivers out | 5 blockers | +0.05 Territory / +0.06 Bomb | +0.6 yards/lateral |
| **Heavy** | Extra blockers, power | 7 blockers | -0.10 Bomb | -0.8 yards/lateral |

**Formation-play coherence:** Formation modifies play family weights before selection. Heavy suppresses kick_pass (×0.4) and lateral_spread (×0.3), boosts dive/power (×1.5). Spread does the opposite.

**Game-state situational overrides:** Short yardage +20% Heavy. Long yardage +20% Spread. Red zone +15% Heavy. Trailing 10+ in Q4 +25% Spread.

**Formation × Defense matchups:** 20 tuples (4 formations × 5 defenses). Examples: Heavy vs Coverage = 1.12 (nothing to cover). Spread vs Coverage = 0.85 (blankets all receivers). Spread vs Pressure = 1.08 (extra receivers punish blitzes).

---

## Part 5: Existing Offensive Styles (11 total)

Each style is a dict containing: play family weights, kick_pass_weights (sub-family distribution), formation_weights, tempo, lateral risk tolerance, and situational triggers.

### The Original 9

**Ground & Pound** — Heavy run, all 6 downs. Dives and powers. Low tempo, low lateral risk. Kick passes are rare play-action Quick Kicks. Formation: mostly Tight/Heavy.

**Lateral Spread** — Constant lateral chains. High variance, high reward. Kick-Lateral is a core weapon. Bell rates high both directions. Formation: mostly Spread.

**Boot Raid** — Advance to the "Launch Pad" (field position 55–85), then shift to kick-heavy play selection. Snap kicks and place kicks are the primary scoring weapons. Formation: Split/Tight.

**Ball Control** — Conservative, clock-eating. Dives and powers, rarely laterals. Kicks field goals when in range. Lowest fumble rate. Formation: Tight/Heavy.

**Ghost Formation** — Counter plays, Viper jets, constant motion. Highest Viper usage. Misdirection-heavy. Uses the "Ghost" formation shell (+10% counter/Viper Jet rates). Formation: Split/Spread.

**Rouge Hunt** — Defense-first offense. Punts early and deep for pindown points. Flip the field, force mistakes, score on margins. The most unusual philosophy. Formation: Tight.

**Chain Gang** — Maximum lateral plays. In close games, lateral selection amplifies further. Feast or famine. Highest Bell production both ways. Formation: Spread.

**Triple Threat** — Single-wing misdirection. Direct snaps to the Power Flanker. Three players (ZB, Viper, Flanker) are all primary threats. Heavy on counters and draws. Formation: Split/Tight.

**Balanced** — No strong tendencies. Adapts to game situation. Moderate tempo, mix of everything. Hardest to gameplan against. Formation: Split.

### The 2 New Styles (Recently Specced)

**East Coast** — Rhythm-based kick pass offense. Starts with Quick Kicks and short Territory passes, building a "rhythm meter" (0–100). As rhythm builds, unlocks deeper kicks. A cold start from turnover or punt resets rhythm. If rhythm stays high, the offense becomes lethal — Territory completions climb, Bombs open up. If rhythm breaks, the offense stalls. Unique mechanic: **Rhythm Escalation** — consecutive completions boost subsequent completion probability. Formation: Split (47%), Spread (40%).

**Shock & Awe** — Volume shooting. Fire Bombs and Territory kicks at a high rate, accepting low completion percentages because the ones that connect produce explosive plays. Unique mechanic: **Volume Shooting** — the offense doesn't care about completion percentage; it cares about yards per attempt. A 35% completion rate on Bombs is fine if the completions average 35+ yards. Also exports **Tempo Fatigue** to the defense — the constant deep threat exhausts the secondary. Formation: Spread (77%).

---

## Part 6: Existing Defensive Styles (5 total)

### Base
Balanced, no specialization. Default defender selection, no weighting bias. Standard 3-man rush with 10% blitz chance.

### Pressure
Aggressive, blitz-heavy. Sends extra rushers (4-man base rush, 35% blitz for a 5th). Thins the secondary. Dominates sack contests but gives up explosive plays when beaten.

### Contain
Disciplined, assignment-sound. Spotbacks and Cornerbacks stay in position. Nobody freelances. Suppresses laterals and sweeps. Worst against power interior runs because it won't overcommit.

### Run-Stop
Loaded box. Interior defenders dominate. Edge defenders crash inside. Stops dives and powers cold but vulnerable to kick passes and sweeps outside because the secondary is undermanned.

### Coverage
Secondary-heavy. Cornerbacks and Lastback prioritized. Lighter box. Blankets kick pass targets but gives up interior running yards because fewer bodies are at the point of attack.

### Defense × Offense Matchup Matrix

Each offensive style has matchup multipliers against each defensive style. These are yardage modifiers (1.0 = neutral):

| | Base | Pressure | Contain | Run-Stop | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ground & Pound | 1.00 | 1.05 | 0.92 | 0.78 | 1.12 |
| Lateral Spread | 1.00 | 1.08 | 0.78 | 1.15 | 0.90 |
| Boot Raid | 1.00 | 0.95 | 1.05 | 1.10 | 0.88 |
| Ball Control | 1.00 | 1.02 | 0.95 | 0.82 | 1.08 |
| Ghost | 1.00 | 1.10 | 0.85 | 1.05 | 0.95 |
| Rouge Hunt | 1.00 | 0.90 | 1.02 | 0.98 | 1.00 |
| Chain Gang | 1.00 | 1.12 | 0.75 | 1.08 | 0.95 |
| Triple Threat | 1.00 | 1.05 | 0.88 | 0.95 | 1.02 |
| Balanced | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

---

## Part 7: Systems That Constrain Design

Any new style you propose must interact cleanly with these systems:

### Time of Possession
Tempo attribute (0.0–1.0) determines seconds per play. Low tempo = 34–38s (huddle, grinding). High tempo = 18–22s (no-huddle). This directly controls how many plays a team runs per game (~60–100+ per team depending on matchup).

### Solved Puzzle (Mid-Game Adaptation)
The Defensive Coordinator tracks play family frequency. When a family is used too often (threshold depends on DC instincts), the DC "solves" it — +15% yardage suppression for the rest of the game. Offenses that are too predictable get punished. New styles need enough play family diversity to avoid being solved early.

### Composure System
Dynamic 60–140 rating per team that shifts based on game events (turnovers, touchdowns, sacks, big plays). Below 70 = Tilt (awareness drops, fumble rate up). Above 130 = surging. New styles should consider how they interact with composure — high-variance styles create more composure swings.

### Weather
Six conditions (Clear, Rain, Snow, Sleet, Extreme Heat, Heavy Wind) with mechanical impacts on fumble rates, kick accuracy, stamina drain, and speed. Any style heavily dependent on one mechanic (e.g., kick passes, laterals) has a built-in weather vulnerability. Good designs acknowledge this.

### Coaching Personality
Coaching staff personality sliders (aggression, risk_tolerance, chaos_appetite, etc.) modulate play selection, kick/go decisions, and variance. A style that only works with one coaching personality type is too narrow.

### Hero Ball / Star Override
Up to 3 stars per team get individual resolution instead of team halo. Styles can lean into star usage (force-feeding touches to a hot player) or distribute. Defensive keying counters hero ball after consecutive star touches.

### Formation × Defense Interaction
New offensive styles must specify formation_weights. New defensive styles must specify how they interact with all 4 formations.

---

## Part 8: What Makes a Good New Style

### For Offense

A new offensive style needs:

1. **A `play_family_weights` dict** — probability distribution across the 7 run families + kick_pass + lateral_spread + trick_play
2. **A `kick_pass_weights` dict** — distribution across Quick Kick, Territory, Bomb, Kick-Lateral
3. **A `formation_weights` dict** — distribution across Tight, Split, Spread, Heavy
4. **Tempo** (0.0–1.0)
5. **At least one situational trigger** — a game-state condition that modifies behavior (e.g., Boot Raid's Launch Pad, Chain Gang's close-game amplification)
6. **A unique mechanical identity** — something this style does that no other style does. A weight distribution alone isn't a style; it's a spreadsheet.
7. **Matchup multipliers** against all 5 defensive styles
8. **A weather vulnerability profile** — what conditions hurt this style, what conditions help it
9. **Expected statistical signature** — what should this style's box score look like? TDs per game, kick pass attempts, lateral chains, Bell rate, snap kick attempts.

### For Defense

A new defensive style needs:

1. **Personnel weights** for 4 contest surfaces (run tackler pool, kick pass coverage pool, lateral pursuit pool, rush count + blitz chance)
2. **Matchup multipliers** against all 11 offensive styles
3. **Formation interaction** — how does this defense perform against Tight/Split/Spread/Heavy?
4. **A unique identity** — what does this defense take away? What does it concede?
5. **A Solved Puzzle interaction** — how fast does this defense adapt to offensive tendencies?
6. **Weather affinity** — does this defense get better or worse in bad conditions?

## Part 9: Design Space — Where to Look for Inspiration

Viperball's rules create openings that gridiron football doesn't have. The sport is closer to rugby, AFL, and arena football in its flow. When designing new styles, think beyond football:

### From Rugby Union/League
- **Phase play:** Structured sequences of carries designed to systematically shift the defensive line before striking. Viperball's 6-down system supports multi-phase drives where the first 3 downs set up the kill shot on downs 4-6.
- **Kick-chase:** Punting ahead and sprinting to contest the catch. Viperball's live-ball-after-kick rules make this viable.
- **Ruck recycling:** Quick ball from contested situations. Viperball's lateral chains can simulate this — short laterals to maintain momentum rather than long chains for yardage.
- **Cross-field kicking:** Angled kicks to exploit defensive overloads on one side. Kick passes in Viperball could target the weak side consistently.

### From Australian Rules Football
- **Inside-50 strategy:** AFL teams shift their entire tactical approach when they enter the attacking zone. Viperball's Launch Pad concept (Boot Raid) is already an example of this. Other zone-based tactical shifts are wide open.
- **Contested marks:** High balls into traffic where the offensive player competes for the catch. Bomb kick passes into contested coverage could be a deliberate strategy, not just desperation.
- **Corridor play vs. boundary play:** AFL teams choose between playing through the middle of the ground (faster, riskier) or working the boundaries (slower, safer). Viperball could model this as interior vs. perimeter tendencies.
- **Loose man in defense:** AFL defenses create extra numbers at the ball by leaving one opponent unguarded elsewhere. Viperball's Keeper or Lastback could be designed as a "sweeper" who crashes the play from deep.

### From Rugby Sevens
- **Compression and expansion:** Sevens teams compress the defense to one side, then rapidly expand to the other. Viperball's lateral chains and formation shifts could systematically do this.
- **Off-the-ball movement:** In sevens, runners create space by running lines that pull defenders. The Viper's alignment freedom makes this a natural fit.
- **Transition offense:** Sevens teams score most often in transition — turnovers, kick returns, broken play. A defensive-transition offense could prioritize forced turnovers and fast-break scoring.

### From Gaelic Football
- **Solo runs:** Long individual carries punctuated by toe-tapping the ball. The Viper Jet play family already captures some of this energy.
- **Hand passing chains:** Short, quick distribution. Similar to lateral chains but with an emphasis on speed over distance.
- **Mark rule adaptations:** Fair catch mechanics that could interact with the Keeper position.

### From Futsal / Indoor Soccer
- **Power play rotations:** Systematic positional rotations that create numerical advantages. Viperball's Shiftback and Viper could run designed rotation patterns.
- **Fly goalkeeper:** Pulling the keeper up to create an extra attacker. Viperball's Keeper already has offensive potential — an aggressive style could occasionally use the Keeper as an 11th offensive threat.

### From Basketball
- **Pace and space:** High-tempo play designed to create open shots (snap kicks). A tempo-based offense that pushes pace specifically to get more snap kick attempts per game.
- **Ball movement offense:** The ball touches every player before a shot. A Viperball offense could require minimum touch counts before scoring.
- **Zone defense principles:** Defending areas rather than players. Viperball's defensive styles could incorporate zone concepts for kick pass coverage.

### From Pesäpallo (Finnish Baseball)
- **Already borrowed:** The missed-kick-retains-possession rule comes directly from pesäpallo. More of its strategic concepts are available — particularly the idea that the batting team controls the tempo of play and the fielding team reacts.

### From Lacrosse
- **Settled offense vs. fast break:** Lacrosse teams play very differently in transition vs. settled. Viperball styles could have distinct "transition" and "settled" modes.
- **Ride and clear:** The equivalent of punt return coverage. After a turnover, the losing team aggressively contests the new possession while the gaining team runs a designed clearing pattern.
- **Dodging and feeding:** Individual 1v1 moves that create assists. The ZB's ability to run, kick, or lateral on any play mirrors a lacrosse attackman's triple-threat position.

---

## Part 10: Constraints and Guardrails

### Hard Rules (Cannot Be Violated)
- No forward pass. Ever. Under any circumstance.
- 11 players per side. No power plays on offense (those are defensive penalty mechanics).
- The Viper must wear a different colored jersey.
- Scoring values are fixed (9/5/3/2/1/½).
- 6 downs, 20 yards. Not negotiable.
- The 4th down decision point (go or kick mode) is structural.

### Soft Guidelines (Can Be Stretched)
- Formation shells are currently 4 (Tight/Split/Spread/Heavy). A new formation shell could be proposed if it creates genuinely different mechanics, but the bar is high.
- Play families are currently 7 run types + kick_pass + lateral_spread + trick_play. New play families can be proposed but must be mechanically distinct from existing ones.
- The 5 defensive styles are designed to be expandable. New defensive styles should occupy genuinely different territory in the "what do you take away / what do you concede" matrix.

### Statistical Targets (Per Team Per Game)
- Touchdowns: 2–4
- Snap kick attempts: 1.6–2.1
- Place kick attempts: 2.4–3.2
- Total score: 42–52 (combined both teams ~85–105)
- Punts: 2.2–2.6
- Bells: 1.0–4.0 (varies by style)
- Total plays: ~45–55 per team (depends on tempo)
- Turnovers: 2–4 per game total

A new style doesn't need to hit every target exactly, but it should produce games within this general range. A style that generates 8 TDs per game or 0 snap kicks is broken unless it has a very specific mechanical reason for the deviation.

## Appendix A: Quick Reference — What's Legal on a Viperball Play

After the snap, any player can:
- Run with the ball in any direction
- Lateral (throw backward/sideways) to any teammate
- Kick the ball in any direction (it remains live)
- Block any opponent (within safety rules)
- Recover any live ball (fumble, blocked kick, etc.)
- Attempt a snap kick (drop kick through uprights) for 5 points

A player CANNOT:
- Throw the ball forward (dead ball + penalty)
- Form a wedge of 3+ blockers (safety penalty)
- Be in forward motion at the snap (illegal motion)

## Appendix B: Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Bell | Half-point scored for recovering an opponent's loose ball |
| Bomb | Long-range kick pass (26–45 yards). Low completion, high reward. |
| Composure | Dynamic team state (60–140) affecting performance under pressure |
| Ghost | Formation shell with -10% DC read chance (harder to diagnose pre-snap) |
| Halo | Team-level offensive/defensive baseline derived from prestige |
| Hero Ball | Force-feeding touches to a hot star player |
| Keeper | Deepest defensive player. Fields missed kicks, deflects snap kicks. |
| Kick Mode | Downs 5–6 after committing to kicking on 4th down decision |
| Kick-Lateral | Hybrid play: kick pass to receiver who immediately laterals |
| Launch Pad | Field position 55–85 where Boot Raid offense shifts to kick-heavy play selection |
| Pesäpallo Rule | Missed snap kicks retain possession (ball dead at LOS, down advances) |
| Pindown | 1 point scored when a kick reaches the end zone and isn't returned (CFL rouge) |
| Quick Kick | Short kick pass (5–12 yards). High completion, low risk. |
| Sacrifice | Field position penalty proportional to the lead after opponent scores |
| Snap Kick | Drop kick through uprights for 5 points. Can be attempted on any down. |
| Solved Puzzle | DC has identified an offensive tendency and applies +15% suppression |
