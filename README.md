## 1. Fundamentals

### Origin

Viperball began as a thought experiment inspired by a Reddit discussion about whether a late-19th-century team could compete in modern football.

Original thread: [What if the entire 1894 Yale team came back to life?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r4qgd3/what_if_the_entire_1894_yale_team_came_back_to/)

The discussion raised a key question: if early teams played under rules closer to their own era—no forward pass, heavier kicking, fewer specialized roles—what would a modern version of that game look like? Viperball is the answer to that question, creating a modern tactical sport that honors the historical roots of football while developing its own strategic depth.

### The Universal Code

Viperball is a "first of its kind" gridiron code designed for universal accessibility and high-speed flow. Similar to how Netball established its own technical identity distinct from basketball, Viperball removes the collision-heavy requirements of traditional football to create a sport optimized for athletic versatility. 

**Designed with Women in Mind:** While the rules are universal, Viperball was intentionally developed to reward the technical proficiency, lateral coordination, and endurance common in elite women's athletics (Soccer, Rugby 7s, and Track). By prioritizing speed and tactical IQ over raw mass, it provides a premium gridiron experience for women's collegiate and professional play.

### Design Philosophy

Viperball assumes a timeline where:

- The forward pass never became dominant
- Kicking remained central to strategy
- Players continued to play both ways
- Football evolved around space, stamina, and field position.
- The game serves as a modernized platform for women's gridiron and speed-based football.

### Players

- 11 players per side

#### Substitution Rules

**Substitution Type:**
- Unlimited substitutions are permitted
- Substitutions may only occur during dead-ball stoppages (after the play is ruled dead and before the next snap)
- On-the-fly substitutions during live play are prohibited

**Active Roster:**
- Teams maintain a 36-player active game-day roster
- All active players are eligible to play

**Substitution Procedure:**
- A player exiting the field must fully leave the playing surface before their replacement enters
- Substituting players must enter and exit from the team's designated sideline area
- Failure to follow proper procedure results in an **Illegal Substitution** penalty (5 yards, enforced at snap)

**Injury Substitutions:**
- A player removed from the game due to injury may not return for a minimum of one play
- If the injury occurs during the final two minutes of a half, the injured player's team is charged a timeout (see §14 Clock Management for full injury timeout protocol)
- Players removed under concussion protocol may not return to the same game (see §25 Player Safety)

### Equipment

- Pads optional depending on league level
- Helmets recommended for competitive play

#### Ball Specifications

**The official game ball is a Canadian football (CFL-spec).**

- **Circumference:** 12⅞ to 13⅛ inches (short axis); 27¾ to 28¼ inches (long axis)
- **Weight:** 14 to 15 ounces
- **Material:** Leather or approved composite
- **Inflation:** 12.5 to 13.5 psi

**Rationale:** The Canadian football's slightly rounder shape compared to an American football supports drop-kick accuracy and bounce predictability, which are central to Viperball strategy.

**Ball Provision:**
- Each team must provide a set of game balls
- Officials inspect and approve all balls before the game
- Balls found to be improperly inflated or damaged during play will be replaced
