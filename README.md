# VIPERBALL — Official Rulebook (v1.0)

## Origin

Viperball began as a thought experiment inspired by a Reddit discussion about whether a late-19th-century team could compete in modern football.

Original thread: [What if the entire 1894 Yale team came back to life?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r4qgd3/what_if_the_entire_1894_yale_team_came_back_to/)

The discussion raised a key question: if early teams played under rules closer to their own era—no forward pass, heavier kicking, fewer specialized roles—what would a modern version of that game look like?

## Design Philosophy

Viperball assumes a timeline where:

- The forward pass never became dominant
- Kicking remained central to strategy
- Players continued to play both ways
- Football evolved around space, stamina, and field positiond.

### Players

- 11 players per side
- Substitutions permitted (league may define limits)

### Equipment

- Pads optional depending on league level
- Helmets recommended for competitive play

---

## 2. Game Structure

### Game Length

- 4 quarters
- 12–15 minutes each
- Running clock except final 2 minutes of each half

League organizers may adjust timing.

---

## 3. Downs & Possession

- 5 downs to gain 20 yards
- Gaining 20 yards resets the count
- Failure after 5 downs results in turnover at the spot

---

## 4. Movement of the Ball

Teams may advance the ball by:

- Running
- Laterals and backward passes
- Kicking (punt or drop kick)

### Forward Pass

Forward passes are not permitted.

Any forward throw results in:

- Dead ball
- Loss of down
- Penalty yardage (league-defined)

---

## 5. Kicking

Kicking may occur at any time during live play.

Players may:

- Punt forward
- Drop kick
- Attempt field goals
- Kick ahead and pursue

The ball remains live after a kick unless it passes through the uprights for a scoring play or goes out of bounds.

---

## 6. Scoring

### Touchdown — 9 points

Scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. No conversion attempts are taken.

### Drop-Kick Field Goal — 5 points

A successful drop kick through the uprights. May be attempted from scrimmage or during live play.

### Place-Kick Field Goal — 3 points

A successful place kick through the uprights. Must be taken from scrimmage.

### Safety — 2 points

Awarded to the defense when the offensive team is downed in its own end zone.

---

## 7. Restarts

### After Touchdown

Scoring team kicks off from midfield or its own 35 (league preference).

### After Field Goal

Opposing team receives kickoff.

### After Safety

Free kick from scoring team's 20.

---

## 8. Tackling & Blocking

### Tackling

- Rugby-style wrap tackling permitted
- No targeting of head or neck
- Dangerous contact penalized

### Blocking

- Open-field blocking allowed
- Blindside blocks restricted
- No wedge formations

---

## 9. Fumbles & Possession

- Live ball on fumble
- Any player may recover
- Ball remains live after kicks unless ruled dead

---

## 10. Out of Bounds

- Ball carrier out of bounds results in dead ball
- Kicked ball out of bounds results in possession at exit spot

---

## 11. Players on the Field

Each team shall field eleven players. No more than eleven players may participate in play at any time. A team must have no fewer than nine players on the field to continue play. If a team falls below nine players, the referee may suspend play until the number is restored.

---

## 12. Offensive Positions

At the snap, the offensive team shall satisfy positional distribution requirements for legal formation. Positional titles exist for alignment and enforcement only and do not restrict movement once the ball is live.

### Linemen

Five players shall be designated as Linemen at the snap. Linemen must align within one yard of the line of scrimmage and between the outermost offensive players. Linemen may advance, lateral, receive laterals, and kick once the ball is live. Linemen are eligible to recover all live balls.

### Zeroback

Each offensive formation must include one Zeroback. The Zeroback is the primary distributor and may receive the snap directly. The Zeroback may run, lateral, or kick at any time. A different player may receive the snap, but the Zeroback designation must still be present on the field.

### Halfback

One Halfback must be present. The Halfback may receive handoffs, laterals, or kicks and may kick in open play.

### Wingbacks

One Left Wingback (LW) and one Right Wingback (RW) must be present at the snap. Wingbacks must align outside the interior formation.

### Shiftback

One Shiftback shall be designated at the snap. The Shiftback aligns between the interior and perimeter and may block, run, lateral, receive kicks, or defend. The Shiftback may shift position prior to the snap provided the minimum offensive structure remains intact.

### Viper

One Viper shall be designated at the snap. The Viper is alignment-exempt and may position freely at any depth or width. The Viper shall wear a jersey of a distinctly different color from the rest of the team.

### Offensive 11

| Position | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Linemen | 5 |
| Zeroback | 1 |
| Halfback | 1 |
| Left Wingback (LW) | 1 |
| Right Wingback (RW) | 1 |
| Shiftback | 1 |
| Viper | 1 |

---

## 13. Defensive Positions

At the snap, the defensive team shall satisfy positional distribution requirements for legal formation. Positional titles exist for alignment and enforcement only and do not restrict movement once the ball is live.

### Line Anchors

Three players shall be designated as Line Anchors at the snap: Left Guard, Nose, and Right Guard. Line Anchors must align within one yard of the line of scrimmage. Left Guard and Right Guard provide front line pressure. The Nose serves as the central anchor point.

### Edge Defenders

Two Edge Defenders must be present at the snap. Edge Defenders align outside the Line Anchors.

### Spotbacks

Two Spotbacks must be present at the snap. Spotbacks align behind the primary defensive line.

### Cornerbacks

Two Cornerbacks must be present at the snap.

### Lastback

One Lastback must be present at the snap. The Lastback aligns deep.

### Keeper

One Keeper must be present at the snap. The Keeper is the deepest defender and fields missed field goal attempts.

### Defensive 11

| Position | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Left Guard | 1 |
| Nose | 1 |
| Right Guard | 1 |
| Edge Defenders | 2 |
| Spotbacks | 2 |
| Cornerbacks | 2 |
| Lastback | 1 |
| Keeper | 1 |

- Defensive alignment violations: five-yard penalty enforced at the snap

---

## 15. Motion

One offensive player may be in motion at the snap provided that player is moving laterally or backward. No player may be in forward motion at the snap.

---

## 16. Positional Freedom After Snap

Once the ball is live, all players may move freely. Positional designations apply only at the moment of the snap for purposes of formation legality and officiating.

---

## 17. Optional Variations

Leagues may experiment with:

- Substitution limits
- Clock rules
- Field-goal distance bonuses
- Overtime formats
