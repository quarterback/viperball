# VIPERBALL — Official Rulebook (Draft v0.1)

## Origin

Viperball began as a thought experiment inspired by a Reddit discussion about whether a late-19th-century team could compete in modern football.

Original thread:
**“What if the entire 1894 Yale team came back to life?”**
https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r4qgd3/what_if_the_entire_1894_yale_team_came_back_to/

The discussion raised a key question:
If early teams played under rules closer to their own era—no forward pass, heavier kicking, fewer specialized roles—what would a modern version of that game look like?


---

## Design Philosophy

Viperball assumes a timeline where:

* The forward pass never became dominant
* Kicking remained central to strategy
* Players continued to play both ways
* Football evolved around space, stamina, and field position

The goal is not novelty, but plausibility:
a version of football that could realistically have existed.

---

## 1. Field & Equipment

### Field

* Standard gridiron field (100 yards between goal lines)
* End zones: 10 yards each
* Standard uprights
* Standard hash marks
* Sidelines and markings identical to traditional football

### Ball

* Standard American football

### Players

* 11 players per side
* Teams are encouraged to use two-way players
* Substitutions permitted but not continuous free rotation (league may define limits)

### Equipment

* Rugby-style tackling permitted
* Pads optional depending on league level
* Helmets recommended for competitive play

---

## 2. Game Structure

### Game Length

Recommended:

* 4 quarters
* 12–15 minutes each
* Running clock except final 2 minutes of each half

League organizers may adjust timing.

---

## 3. Downs & Possession

### Downs

* 5 downs to gain 20 yards
* Gaining 20 yards resets the count
* Failure after 5 downs = turnover at spot

This replaces the modern 4-for-10 system and reflects the run-heavy nature of Viperball.

---

## 4. Movement of the Ball

Teams may advance the ball by:

* Running
* Laterals/backward passes
* Kicking (punt or drop kick)

### Forward Pass

Forward passes are not permitted.

Any forward throw results in:

* dead ball
* loss of down
* penalty yardage (league-defined)

---

## 5. Kicking (Core Feature)

Kicking may occur at any time during live play.

Players may:

* Punt forward
* Drop kick
* Attempt field goals
* Kick ahead and pursue

The ball remains live after a kick unless it passes through the uprights for a scoring play or goes out of bounds.

Kicking is considered an offensive weapon equivalent to the passing game in modern football.

---

## 6. Scoring

### Touchdown

9 points
Scored by advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone.

No conversion attempts are taken.

---

### Drop-Kick Field Goal

5 points
A successful drop kick through the uprights.

May be attempted:

* From scrimmage
* During live play

---

### Place-Kick Field Goal

3 points
A successful place kick through the uprights.

Must be taken from scrimmage.

---

### Safety

2 points
Awarded to the defense when the offensive team is downed in its own end zone.

---

## 7. Restarts

### After Touchdown

Scoring team kicks off from midfield or its own 35 (league preference).

### After Field Goal

Opposing team receives kickoff.

### After Safety

Standard free kick from scoring team’s 20.

---

## 8. Tackling & Blocking

### Tackling

* Rugby-style wrap tackling encouraged
* No targeting of head/neck
* Dangerous contact penalized

### Blocking

* Open-field blocking allowed
* Blindside blocks restricted
* No wedge formations

Blocking exists but is lighter and more mobile than modern trench football.

---

## 9. Fumbles & Possession

* Live ball on fumble
* Any player may recover
* Ball remains live after kicks unless ruled dead

---

## 10. Out of Bounds

* Ball carrier out of bounds = dead ball
* Kicked ball out of bounds = possession at exit spot

---

## 11. Defensive Structure (Recommended Roles)

Viperball defenses typically include:

### Linemen

Interior defenders and blockers.

### Edge Defenders

Contain sweeps
Rush kickers
Set outside edge

### Spotbacks

Hybrid linebacker/safety roles
React to laterals
Control interior space

### Cornerbacks

Outside coverage
Kick pursuit
Contain wide runs

Players commonly play both offense and defense.

---

## 12. Offensive Structure (Recommended Roles)

Typical roles include:

* Zeroback (primary distributor and kicker)
* Halfback
* Wingbacks
* Flex players
* Mobile linemen

Offense revolves around:

* Sweep runs
* Laterals
* Tactical kicking
* Field position

---

## 13. Philosophy of Play

Viperball emphasizes:

* Field position
* Stamina
* Tactical kicking
* Two-way play
* Continuous decision-making

It represents a version of football where the forward pass never became dominant and kicking remained central to strategy.

---

## 14. Optional Variations

Leagues may experiment with:

* Substitution limits
* Clock rules
* Field-goal distance bonuses
* Overtime formats

Core rules should remain intact.

## Status

This is an open-source sport specification.
Anyone is free to:

* Playtest
* Modify rules
* Fork the project
* Run pickup games or leagues
* Propose changes
