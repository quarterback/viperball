**A collegiate dynasty simulator for a sport that never existed — and plays like nothing you've seen.**

## Where This Started

It started with a Reddit thread.

Someone in r/CFB posted a hypothetical: *[What if the entire 1894 Yale team came back to life and played a modern college football team?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r4qgd3/what_if_the_entire_1894_yale_team_came_back_to/)* The discussion spiraled into something more interesting than the original question — if early football teams played under rules closer to their own era, no forward pass, heavier emphasis on kicking, no specialized roles, what would a *modern* version of that game actually look like?

That question is Viperball.
