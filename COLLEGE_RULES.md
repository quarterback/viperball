# COLLEGIATE VIPERBALL RULES (CVL v1.0)

## Collegiate Viperball League (CVL) Official Rulebook

This document outlines the specific rules and regulations for the Collegiate Viperball League (CVL), a conference-based system for American universities that do not currently have football programs.

---

## 1. Game Structure

### Quarter Length
- **15-minute quarters** (4 quarters per game)
- Total game time: 60 minutes of regulation play
- Overtime rules follow the standard Viperball overtime format (see main rulebook §26)

### Clock Management
All standard Viperball clock rules apply (see main rulebook §14), with the following collegiate-specific addition:

**First Down Chain Setting:**
- The game clock **stops** when a first down is achieved to allow officials to set the chains
- The clock restarts on the referee's signal once chains are set
- This rule ensures proper measurement and fair play at the collegiate level

---

## 2. Roster & Player Rules

### Active Roster
- **36 players** maximum on the active game-day roster
- All roster spots are for **two-way players** (no specialists)
- Players are expected to play both offense and defense
- Substitutions follow standard Viperball rules (see main rulebook §30)

### Two-Way Play Philosophy
The CVL emphasizes complete player development and versatility:
- No designated kickers, punters, or returners
- Players rotate between offensive and defensive roles
- Stamina management is a critical strategic element
- Coaches must balance playing time to prevent fatigue-related performance decline

---

## 3. Championship System

### Poll-Based Championship
The CVL uses a **traditional Top 25 poll system** rather than a playoff format:

**Weekly Rankings:**
- Top 25 teams ranked by a combination of:
  1. Win-Loss record
  2. Strength of Schedule (SOS)
  3. Viper Efficiency (advanced metric, see §4)
- Polls released weekly during the season
- Final poll determines the National Champion

**No Playoff System:**
- The #1 ranked team at the end of the regular season is declared National Champion
- Conference champions are crowned within each conference
- Bowl games may be scheduled for top teams but do not determine the championship

---

## 4. Advanced Metrics

### Viper Efficiency
A composite metric measuring team effectiveness:
- **Formula:** (Total Yards Gained / Downs Used) × (1 + Lateral Success Rate) × Viper Impact Factor
- **Components:**
  - Total Yards Gained: All offensive yardage
  - Downs Used: Total number of downs played on offense
  - Lateral Success Rate: (Successful Laterals / Total Lateral Attempts)
  - Viper Impact Factor: Bonus multiplier based on Viper positioning effectiveness (1.0 to 1.5)

### Micro-Scoring Differential
Measures scoring versatility:
- **Formula:** (Drop Kicks Made × 5) - (Place Kicks Made × 3)
- Positive values indicate aggressive drop-kick usage
- Negative values indicate conservative place-kick preference

### Lateral Efficiency
Measures ball-handling security:
- **Formula:** (Successful Lateral Chains / Total Lateral Attempts) × 100%
- Higher percentages indicate better ball security and timing

---

---

## 6. Player Profile: Speed Freaks

### Athletic Philosophy
CVL teams emphasize **high-speed athleticism** over size:
- Players are typically lighter and faster than traditional football athletes
- Average player weight: 180-200 lbs
- Average 40-yard dash: 4.5-4.7 seconds
- Emphasis on endurance, agility, and ball-handling skills

### Technical Kicking
All players receive extensive kicking training:
- Drop-kick technique is a core skill
- Punt accuracy and distance are key evaluation metrics
- Live-ball kicking scenarios are practiced extensively

---

## 7. Game Regulations

### 5-for-20 System
Standard Viperball down system applies:
- **5 downs to gain 20 yards** for a first down
- Distance resets after each first down
- Turnover on downs if team fails to gain 20 yards in 5 downs

### Kicking as Offense
Live-ball kicking is a continuous tactical option:
- **Punts:** Can be executed on any down, ball remains live
- **Drop-Kicks:** Worth 5 points if successful, can be attempted on any down
- **Place-Kicks:** Worth 3 points, typically used on final downs

### Lateral Chains
Multi-player lateral sequences are encouraged:
- Each lateral in a sequence carries a "broken chain" (fumble) probability
- Probability increases with each additional lateral in the chain
- Risk-reward balance is critical to offensive strategy

### Kick Pass (KP)
A controlled kick delivered to a teammate, caught cleanly before touching the ground. Treated as a lateral for turnover and chaos purposes.

**Key Properties:**
- A kick pass is **not a forward pass** (because it is a kick)
- A kick pass **may travel forward** (because kicks are not directionally restricted under §5 of the main rulebook)
- The ball must be caught cleanly — a reception is only credited when the receiver secures possession before the ball contacts the ground

**Outcomes:**
- **Clean catch:** Receiver has possession at the spot of the catch. Play continues — the receiver may run, lateral, or kick again. Down does not advance on a completion.
- **Dropped kick pass (incomplete):** The ball is dead at the line of scrimmage. The offense loses one down. No change in field position.
- **Tipped kick pass:** If the ball is deflected by any player (offense or defense) before being caught or hitting the ground, the ball becomes a **chaos event** — it is live and may be recovered by either team.
- **Defensive interception:** If a defender catches the kick pass cleanly before it touches the ground, the defense gains possession at the spot of the catch.

**Restrictions:**
- Only one kick pass may be attempted per play (a second kick pass on the same play is treated as a punt and follows punt rules)
- A kick pass may not be attempted inside the kicking team's own 10-yard line (to prevent reckless play in the shadow of the team's own end zone)

**Official Signal:**
- The referee signals a completed kick pass by extending one arm forward and pumping the fist twice
- An incomplete kick pass uses the standard incomplete signal (arms crossed overhead)

**CVL Note:** The kick pass is a collegiate-specific interpretation of the live-ball kicking rules in §5 of the main rulebook. It is not currently recognized as a distinct play type in the official Viperball rulebook. The CVL adopts it to encourage creative use of the kicking game and to open up the field beyond lateral chains and backward passing.

## 8. Competitive Balance

### Scheduling
- **8-game conference schedule** (play 5 conference opponents once)
- **3-game non-conference schedule**
- Total: 11 regular season games
- Conference champions determined by conference record

### Strength of Schedule
SOS calculated based on:
- Opponent win percentage
- Opponent's opponents' win percentage
- Geographic adjustments for cross-conference play

---

## 9. Season Structure

### Regular Season
- **11 weeks** (late August through November)
- Bye weeks allowed but not mandatory
- Homecoming games encouraged for alumni engagement

### Championship Week
- Week 12: Conference championship games
- Final Top 25 poll released after championship week
- National Champion crowned

### Bowl Season (Optional)
- Invitation-based bowl games for top teams
- Bowls are exhibition matches and do not affect championship
- Used for team development and fan engagement

---

## 10. League Philosophy

The CVL exists to provide competitive Viperball opportunities to universities that:
1. Do not currently sponsor NCAA football programs
2. Seek a lower-cost alternative to traditional football
3. Value athletic versatility and technical skill development
4. Embrace the unique tactical elements of Viperball

**Mission:** To develop complete athletes who excel in speed, endurance, kicking technique, and tactical awareness while representing their universities with pride and sportsmanship.
