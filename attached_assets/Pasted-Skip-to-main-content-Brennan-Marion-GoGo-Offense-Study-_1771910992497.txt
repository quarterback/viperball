Brennan Marion - GoGo Offense Study w/ Base Plays example
Offense
Hello, it's been a while. Recently I have been examining/studying Brennan Marion's GoGo Offense and catching up on the resources that are available online pertaining to the system. The system itself is founded on a downhill run game mostly focused on various multi-back sets and alignments, varying from Pistol to Double-Sidecar in order to stress the rules of the defense as well as opening up the opportunity for a quasi-triple option zone-read game. The base run concepts of the offense are Outside Zone and Inside Zone with various RPO tags as well as a boot and keeper game combined with more "traditional" spread formations and a heavily influenced West Coast drop-back passing game.


In Brennan's first season as OC at UNLV, his QB compiled 3,085 yards and 17 TDs while their running game compiled 538 total carries for 2,429 yards and 39 TDs.


I designed 3 examples of some of their "base" plays from one of the foundational formations of the offense. Feel free to critique as well as talk ball!

Thanks for the share I’ve gone down the GO-Go rabbit hole

Coach Marion said in an interview “i did a quantum leap study of as much football film as I could find from the begginjng to modern day and 2 back stood the test of time … essentially the Go Go is just WCO Near / Far but out of gun”

And Honestly it’s a really neat formation as you can run outside zone lead and Trips / 4 Strong passing out of the same formation

His double wheel snag is an absolute killer way to essentially force the defense to let you throw to the back lol

I think Gus Malzahn used a similar formation to that ~10 years ago during the Nick Marshall era to run a statue of liberty type of action. Obviously Brennan Marion worked for Gus at one point so not surprising.

Is there anything out there that could be used to create an install plan for an offense at least inspired by the Go Go?

Not in the form of install plans or practice schedules or anything from what I’ve seen. However, there are a couple of playlists on YouTube out there that are a compilation of Brennan Marion clips from coaching clinics and game film from William & Mary when they ran the GoGo, so you could probably bastardize some of that

I know it's been a few months but if you find something I'd love to know. Going down the rabbit hole.

Coaches in the NFL would shut this down, the defense slides side to side

Considering the Seahawks have ran their own interpretations of some of these plays out of this formation for the past few years I think it seems to work well enough

No but I wish Norvell would hire him as OC.

But Norvell does try to run a lot of inside and outside zone along with the RPO and loves to throw to the RB on wheel and screens so there’s already partial concepts already installed which Norvell doesn’t know how to run correctly. The job is his already.. just waiting on HC offers. This offense will be 100% Marions.. Norvell will become the CEO finally..

I hope so. If he can keep his hands off the wheel and let Marion do his thing he without any interference, this could be exciting for the Noles!

Just came across this thread. Anyone have any luck finding a playbook or creating a base set of plays? I'm interested in these concepts as well
