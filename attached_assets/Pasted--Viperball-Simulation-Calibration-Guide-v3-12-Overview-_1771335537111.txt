# Viperball Simulation Calibration Guide v3.12

## Overview

This document provides calibration targets for the Viperball simulation engine. The goal is to produce a dynamic, watchable sport with touchdowns as the primary scoring method, a robust kicking game as a legitimate alternative offensive philosophy, and chaos events (Bells, Pindowns) adding texture.

**Core Design Principles:**

- 6 downs to gain 20 yards (3.33 yards/play to stay on schedule)
- No forward pass—lateral chains replace passing offense
- Kicking is live offense, not just field position management
- TDs are natural and frequent, not rare events
- Kicking-heavy teams are a viable archetype, not a gimmick
- 85–90% defensive success rate creates meaningful defense with explosive exceptions

## Scoring System

|Event                  |Points|Description                                                        |
|-----------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Touchdown              |9     |Ball carried or kicked into end zone                               |
|Snapkick (Drop Kick FG)|5     |Live-ball drop kick through uprights from anywhere                 |
|Place Kick FG          |3     |Traditional place kick from scrimmage                              |
|Safety                 |2     |Offense downed in own end zone or commits foul there               |
|Pindown                |1     |Force opponent to start drive inside own 10-yard line              |
|Bell                   |0.5   |Recover the opposing team’s loose ball (fumble, muff, blocked kick)|

### Pindown (The “Rouge”)

The Pindown is Viperball’s equivalent of the Canadian football “rouge”—a 1-point reward for winning the field position battle decisively.

**When it’s awarded:**

- Your punt lands inside the opponent’s 10-yard line (and isn’t a touchback)
- Your missed field goal pins them inside the 10
- Any kick that forces them to start a drive inside their own 10

**Why it matters:**

- Rewards good punting and field position play
- Creates the “Rouge Hunt” offensive philosophy (stack Pindowns, win 18-12)
- Makes every punt a potential scoring opportunity
- Forces returners to make risky decisions (field it vs. let it bounce)

**Etymology:** “Pindown” comes from the same root as “rouge” in Canadian football—pin them deep, get a point.

### Bell Scoring Rule

A Bell (½ point) is awarded when you **recover the other team’s loose ball**—fumble, muff, or blocked kick.

**You cannot score a Bell on your own turnover recovery.**

|Situation                                     |Bell?                                  |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|You fumble, defense recovers                  |Defense gets ½ point                   |
|You fumble, you recover                       |No score, play continues               |
|Defense fumbles the recovery, you get it back |No score—only the first turnover counts|
|Punt muffed by returner, kicking team recovers|Kicking team gets ½ point              |
|Blocked kick recovered by blocking team       |Blocking team gets ½ point             |
|Missed snap kick, your team recovers          |No Bell—it’s your own kick             |

**One Bell per play, max.** If the ball changes hands three times on a chaotic fumble sequence, only the first clean recovery by the opposing team scores. No chaining.

## Kicking Game Calibration

### Place Kick Field Goals

Place kicks are the reliable, high-percentage option. With larger goalposts and targeted recruiting of Australian, Gaelic, and soccer players, place kicking becomes a developed skill in Viperball.

**Success Rates by Distance:**

|Distance   |Success Rate|Notes               |
|-----------|------------|--------------------|
|<25 yards  |90–95%      |Near-automatic      |
|25–34 yards|82–90%      |Highly reliable     |
|35–44 yards|70–82%      |Standard range      |
|45–54 yards|55–70%      |Long but makeable   |
|55+ yards  |35–50%      |Specialist territory|

**Attempt Frequency (Per Team Per Game):**

|Team Archetype|Attempts|Makes  |Notes                 |
|--------------|--------|-------|----------------------|
|TD-Heavy      |1–2     |0.5–1.5|Only when TD unlikely |
|Balanced      |2–3     |1.5–2.5|Situational           |
|Kick-Heavy    |4–6     |3–4.5  |Primary scoring method|

**AI Playcalling Triggers for Place Kicks:**

- 4th–6th down inside opponent’s 40: Consider place kick
- 5th–6th down inside opponent’s 30: Strong place kick lean
- Trailing by 1–3 points, final 2 minutes: Place kick if in range
- Leading by 7+, any field position: Place kick over risky TD attempt

### Snapkicks (Drop Kick Field Goals)

Snapkicks are the high-risk, high-reward option. They can be attempted from anywhere during live play, but require elite skill. The best Kicking ZBs turn snapkicks into a primary weapon.

**Success Rates by Distance:**

|Distance   |Elite Kicker|Good Kicker|Average Kicker|
|-----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
|<25 yards  |80–88%      |70–78%     |60–70%        |
|25–34 yards|68–78%      |55–65%     |45–55%        |
|35–44 yards|52–65%      |40–50%     |30–40%        |
|45–54 yards|35–48%      |25–35%     |15–25%        |
|55+ yards  |18–30%      |10–18%     |5–12%         |

**Attempt Frequency by Team Archetype:**

|Team Archetype  |Attempts/Game|Makes/Game|Conversion %|
|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|
|TD-Heavy        |0–1          |0–0.5     |50–60%      |
|Balanced        |1–2          |0.5–1     |55–65%      |
|Kick-Heavy      |3–5          |1.5–2.5   |55–70%      |
|Elite Kicking ZB|4–6          |2–3.5     |60–75%      |

**AI Playcalling Triggers for Snapkicks:**

- Kicking ZB teams: Attempt from 45+ yards on 3rd–4th down
- Any team: Consider snapkick on 4th down past midfield if Kicking ZB
- Trailing late: Snapkick attempts increase (5 pts vs 3 pts matters)
- Kick-Heavy archetype: Attempt snapkick before place kick when in range for both

### Punting

Punting remains a field position tool, but should be less frequent than current sim.

**Punt Statistics:**

|Metric                             |Target     |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
|Punts per team per game            |3–5        |
|Average punt distance              |38–45 yards|
|Punts inside 10-yard line          |25–35%     |
|Punts resulting in Pindown         |20–30%     |
|Blocked punts per game (both teams)|0.1–0.3    |
|Muffed punt returns per game       |0.2–0.4    |

**AI Playcalling Triggers for Punts:**

- 5th–6th down in own territory: Punt unless desperate
- 5th down between own 40 and opponent’s 45: Situational (game state)
- 6th down anywhere past own 35: Go for it or kick FG, rarely punt
- Pinned inside own 10: Punt on 4th+ down

## Defensive Calibration

### Tackle/Stop Success Rates

|Metric                        |Target|Creates                  |
|------------------------------|------|-------------------------|
|Overall defensive success rate|85–90%|Meaningful defense       |
|Tackle success rate           |87–92%|Most plays contained     |
|Missed tackle rate            |8–13% |Source of explosive plays|

## Fumble System (CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED)

### Current Problem

Fumbles currently only occur on lateral chain plays. This is a fundamental design flaw that creates two problems:

1. **Lateral chains feel punishing** — Players learn chains = fumble risk, runs = safe. This discourages the signature mechanic of the sport.
1. **It’s unrealistic** — Ball carriers fumble on runs, sweeps, dives, kick returns, and scrambles. Stripping the ball is a core defensive skill.

### New Fumble Model

Fumbles should occur on ANY ball-carrying play, not just lateral chains.

#### Fumble Opportunities by Play Type

|Play Type                 |Can Fumble?|Base Rate        |Notes                               |
|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
|Inside run (dive)         |Yes        |1.5–2.5%         |Lower risk, ball secured            |
|Outside run (sweep/option)|Yes        |2–3%             |More exposure, arm tackles          |
|Lateral chain             |Yes        |2–3% per exchange|Each lateral is a fumble opportunity|
|Punt return               |Yes        |2–4%             |Catching + running in traffic       |
|Kick return (missed FG)   |Yes        |2–3%             |Keeper fielding and returning       |
|Scramble (ZB)             |Yes        |2–3%             |Loose carry while improvising       |
|Designed kick play        |No         |—                |Ball is kicked, not carried         |
|Punt (kicking team)       |No         |—                |But can be blocked/muffed           |

#### Fumble Probability Modifiers

**Ball Carrier Attributes:**

- High Power (80+): −20% to −30% fumble probability
- Low Power (<50): +10% to +15% fumble probability

**Fatigue:**

- Stamina below 70%: +2–3% fumble probability

**Defensive Scheme:**

- Pressure/Blitz defense: +1–2% (more hits)
- Contain defense: No modifier
- Bend Don’t Break: −1% (softer tackles)

**Tackle Type:**

- Standard tackle: Base rate
- Big hit / TFL / Loss of yards: +3–5% additional

**Weather (if implemented):**

- Rain/snow: +2–3%

#### Lateral Chain Specific Logic

Each exchange in a lateral chain has its own fumble check:

```
Per-exchange fumble rate: 2–3%
3-lateral chain: 3 checks at 2.5% each
Cumulative probability: 1 - (0.975)^3 = 7.3% chance of fumble somewhere in chain
```

This makes a 3-lateral chain roughly 3× riskier than a single run (7% vs 2%), which is the correct tradeoff for higher expected yardage.

#### Implementation: Add Fumble Check to Run Plays

```python
def simulate_run(self, family: PlayFamily) -> Play:
    # ... existing run logic ...
    
    # Fumble check for ball carrier
    base_fumble_prob = 0.02  # 2% base for runs
    
    # Adjust by play type
    if family == PlayFamily.DIVE_OPTION:
        base_fumble_prob = 0.015  # Inside runs safer
    elif family in [PlayFamily.SWEEP_OPTION, PlayFamily.SPEED_OPTION]:
        base_fumble_prob = 0.025  # Outside runs riskier
    
    # Modify by carrier attributes
    carrier = self.get_ball_carrier()
    if carrier.power >= 80:
        base_fumble_prob *= 0.75  # Strong carriers hold on
    elif carrier.power < 50:
        base_fumble_prob *= 1.12
    
    # Modify by fatigue
    if carrier.stamina < 70:
        base_fumble_prob += 0.025
    
    # Modify by defensive pressure
    defense = self._current_defense()
    if defense.get("style") == "pressure":
        base_fumble_prob += 0.015
    elif defense.get("style") == "blitz":
        base_fumble_prob += 0.02
    elif defense.get("style") == "bend_dont_break":
        base_fumble_prob -= 0.01
    
    # Big hit check (TFL or loss of yards)
    if yards_gained <= 0:
        base_fumble_prob += 0.03  # Stuffed at line = harder hit
    
    # Fumble roll
    if random.random() < base_fumble_prob:
        return self._create_fumble_play(...)
```

#### Implementation: Add Fumble Check to Returns

```python
def simulate_punt_return(self) -> Play:
    # ... existing return logic ...
    
    # Muff chance on catch
    muff_prob = 0.02
    if weather == "rain":
        muff_prob += 0.02
    
    if random.random() < muff_prob:
        return self._create_muff_play(...)
    
    # Fumble during return
    fumble_prob = 0.03
    # Apply standard modifiers (fatigue, defensive pressure, etc.)
    
    if random.random() < fumble_prob:
        return self._create_fumble_play(...)
```

#### Expected Fumble Distribution Per Game

|Play Type         |Plays/Game|Fumble Rate    |Expected Fumbles|
|------------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
|Runs (all types)  |35–45     |2%             |0.7–0.9         |
|Lateral chains    |15–20     |6–8% cumulative|1.0–1.6         |
|Punt returns      |4–6       |3%             |0.1–0.2         |
|Kick returns      |1–2       |2.5%           |0.02–0.05       |
|**Total per team**|—         |—              |**1.8–2.7**     |

**Both teams combined:** 3.5–5.5 fumbles per game
**Fumbles lost per team (50% recovery):** ~1–1.5 per game

## Turnover and Chaos Events

### Turnovers Per Game (Both Teams Combined)

|Event                              |Frequency|Notes                                     |
|-----------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
|Total fumbles                      |4–6      |Distributed across all ball-carrying plays|
|Fumbles lost (change of possession)|2–3      |~50% recovery rate                        |

## AI Playcalling Logic

### Current Problem with Kick Selection

The existing kick decision logic is purely rule-based with hard-coded field position thresholds and weighted random choices. It never compares expected values, which leads to:

1. **Place kicks being underutilized** — The AI chooses drop kicks or punts when place kicks would be the percentage play
1. **Kicks suppressed on early downs** — Even when a field goal is smart (e.g., 3rd down at opponent’s 25, unlikely to convert), kicks are discouraged
1. **No consideration of kicker skill** — Elite Kicking ZBs should attempt more drop kicks; weak kickers should lean place kicks
1. **Punting from scoring range** — The AI sometimes punts from the opponent’s 40 on 5th down instead of attempting a field goal

### EV-Based Kick Decision System (REPLACEMENT)

Replace the rule-based kick logic with expected value calculations. On every down where a kick is possible, calculate EV for each option and choose the highest.

#### Core Formula

```
EV(place_kick) = success_rate(distance) × 3
EV(drop_kick) = success_rate(distance, kicker_skill) × 5
EV(go_for_it) = conversion_rate(down, ytg) × continuation_value(new_fp)
EV(punt) = opponent_field_position_cost(expected_landing) + pindown_probability × 1
```

#### Success Rate Tables

**Place Kick Success Rate by Distance:**

|Distance |Success Rate|EV (×3 pts)|
|---------|------------|-----------|
|<25 yds  |92%         |2.76       |

#### When to Call This Function

**Option A (Recommended):** Call on every 4th/5th/6th down BEFORE play family selection

```python
def select_play(self):
    down = self.state.down
    
    # On 4th+ down, check if kicking is optimal
    if down >= 4:
        kick_decision = self.select_kick_decision()
        if kick_decision is not None:
            return self.execute_kick(kick_decision)
    
    # Otherwise, select normal play family
    family = self.select_play_family()
    return self.execute_play(family)
```

**Option B:** Replace `_resolve_kick_type` when `territory_kick` is selected

If `territory_kick` is randomly selected, call `select_kick_decision()` to determine kick type. If it returns `None`, re-roll play selection.

#### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: 5th down, opponent’s 28 (fp=72), 8 yards to go**

```
FG distance: 28 + 17 = 45 yards

Place kick: 60% × 3 = 1.80 EV
Drop kick (avg kicker): 38% × 5 = 1.90 EV
Punt: Not considered (inside opp 30)
Go for it: 32% × 3.5 value = 1.12 EV

Winner: DROP KICK (1.90 EV)
```

**Scenario 2: 6th down, opponent’s 22 (fp=78), 14 yards to go**

```
FG distance: 22 + 17 = 39 yards

Place kick: 75% × 3 = 2.25 EV
Drop kick (avg): 38% × 5 = 1.90 EV
Drop kick (elite): 60% × 5 = 3.00 EV
Punt: Not considered
Go for it: 17% × 0.85 aggression × 4.5 = 0.65 EV

Winner: PLACE KICK (2.25 EV) for average kicker
Winner: DROP KICK (3.00 EV) for elite kicker
```

**Scenario 3: 4th down, opponent’s 35 (fp=65), 2 yards to go**

```
FG distance: 35 + 17 = 52 yards

Place kick: 55% × 3 = 1.65 EV
Drop kick: 32% × 5 = 1.60 EV
Punt: ~1.2 EV
Go for it: 65% × 1.15 aggression × 3.0 = 2.24 EV

Winner: GO FOR IT (2.24 EV)
```

**Scenario 4: 5th down, own 45 (fp=45), 12 yards to go**

```
FG distance: 55 + 17 = 72 yards (out of range)

Place kick: Not available
Drop kick: Not available
Punt: Expected landing at opp 15, value = ~0.8 EV
Go for it: 20% × 1.5 = 0.30 EV

Winner: PUNT (0.80 EV)
```

## Pindown Rule (CFL Rouge Logic)

The Pindown (1 point) uses Canadian Football League rouge logic—you score when the ball dies in the end zone, not just when you pin them deep.

### Pindown Situations

|Situation                                                    |Pindown?    |Result      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|
|Punt lands in end zone, returner kneels/doesn’t return       |**Yes (+1)**|Ball at 20  |
|Punt goes through end zone (out the back)                    |**Yes (+1)**|Ball at 20  |
|Punt goes out of bounds in end zone                          |**Yes (+1)**|Ball at 20  |
|Missed snap kick goes through/out of end zone                |**Yes (+1)**|Ball at 20  |
|Missed snap kick fielded by Keeper, Keeper kneels in end zone|**Yes (+1)**|Ball at 20  |
|Returner fields it in end zone and runs it out past the 10   |**No**      |Ball at spot|
|Punt lands inside the 10 but not in end zone                 |**No**      |Ball at spot|
|Touchback (ball goes into end zone, placed at 20)            |**No**      |Ball at 20  |

### Key Distinction

- **Old (incorrect) rule:** Pin opponent inside their 10 → Pindown
- **New (CFL) rule:** Ball dies in the end zone → Pindown

The returner has a chance to escape. If they field it and bring it out, no Pindown. If the ball dies in the end zone (kneeled, out of bounds, through the back), the kicking team gets a point.

### Implementation

```python
def resolve_kick_into_endzone(self, kick_result):
    """Handle kicks that reach the end zone."""
    
    if kick_result.landing == 'end_zone':
        if kick_result.returner_escaped:
            # Returner brought it out past the goal line — no Pindown
            self.state.field_position = kick_result.return_spot
            return {'pindown': False}
        else:
            # Ball died in end zone (kneeled, downed, no return) — Pindown!
            self.award_pindown(kick_result.kicking_team)
            self.state.field_position = 20
            return {'pindown': True, 'points': 1}
    
    if kick_result.landing == 'through_end_zone':
        # Out the back — automatic Pindown
        self.award_pindown(kick_result.kicking_team)
        self.state.field_position = 20
        return {'pindown': True, 'points': 1}
    
    if kick_result.landing == 'out_of_bounds_endzone':
        # Out the side in end zone — Pindown
        self.award_pindown(kick_result.kicking_team)
        self.state.field_position = 20
        return {'pindown': True, 'points': 1}
    
    # Ball landed in field of play
    self.state.field_position = kick_result.landing_spot
    return {'pindown': False}


def simulate_punt_return(self, punt_result):
    """Simulate the return decision when ball lands in end zone."""
    
    if punt_result.landing_spot >= 100:  # In end zone
        keeper = self.get_keeper()
        
        # Keeper decision: return it or kneel?
        # Factors: punt hang time, coverage distance, keeper speed
        escape_probability = self.calculate_escape_probability(
            keeper_speed=keeper.speed,
            coverage_distance=punt_result.coverage_distance,
            punt_hang_time=punt_result.hang_time
        )
        
        if random.random() < escape_probability:
            # Keeper attempts return
            return_yards = self.simulate_return_yards(keeper, punt_result)
            if return_yards > 0:
                # Escaped! No Pindown
                return {'escaped': True, 'return_spot': return_yards}
            else:
                # Tackled in end zone — Safety? Or just Pindown?
                # If tackled in end zone on a return attempt, it's a Safety (2 pts)
                return {'escaped': False, 'safety': True}
        else:
            # Keeper kneels — Pindown
            return {'escaped': False, 'kneeled': True}
```

### Escape Probability Factors

|Factor                         |Effect on Escape                        |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|Keeper speed (high)            |+15-25% escape chance                   |
|Punt hang time (long)          |−10-20% escape chance (coverage arrives)|
|Coverage distance (close)      |−15-25% escape chance                   |
|Punt lands at goal line vs deep|+10% if at goal line                    |
|Weather (rain/snow)            |−10% escape chance                      |

### Strategic Implications

**For the kicking team (especially Rouge Hunt style):**

- High hang time punts give coverage time to arrive
- Directional punts toward the corner limit escape routes
- The threat of the Pindown forces risky return attempts → potential Bells

**For the returning team:**

- Aggressive Keepers who return everything risk Safeties
- Conservative Keepers who kneel concede easy Pindowns
- The decision is a real gamble every time

## Offensive Playstyle System (EXPANDED)

The current sim has 5 playstyles. This section expands to 8 distinct offensive philosophies, each with unique play selection weights, risk tolerances, and scoring priorities.

-----

### Playstyle Overview

|Style              |Philosophy                             |Primary Score        |Risk Level|Down Usage               |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|-------------------------|
|**Ground & Pound** |Grind 20 yards, punch it in            |TD (9)               |Low       |All 6 downs              |
|**Lateral Spread** |Horizontal stretch, chain attacks      |TD (9)               |High      |Aggressive early         |
|**Boot Raid**      |Get to the 45, start kicking           |Snap Kick (5)        |Medium    |1-2 downs to “Launch Pad”|
|**Ball Control**   |Conservative, clock management         |Place Kick (3)       |Very Low  |All 6 downs, slow        |
|**Ghost Formation**|Viper chaos, pre-snap confusion        |TD (9)               |Medium    |Situational              |
|**Rouge Hunt**     |Field position, defensive scoring      |Pindown (1), Bell (½)|Very Low  |Punt early, pin deep     |
|**Chain Gang**     |Maximum laterals, all-or-nothing       |TD (9)               |Very High |Aggressive               |
|**Triple Threat**  |Single-wing, direct snaps, misdirection|Mixed                |Low       |Methodical               |

-----

### 1. Ground & Pound

**Philosophy:** Old-school power football. Use all 6 downs to move 20 yards. Wear down the defense. Score touchdowns.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
weights = {
    'dive_option': 0.35,
    'power_option': 0.25,
    'sweep_option': 0.20,
    'speed_option': 0.10,
    'lateral_spread': 0.08,
    'territory_kick': 0.02,
}
```

**Tendencies:**

- Run-to-lateral ratio: 85/15
- Snap kick attempts: Rare (only when trailing late)
- Place kick usage: Only on 6th down when stalled
- Clock management: Burn clock, long drives
- Risk tolerance: Low—avoid laterals in own territory

**Ideal Roster:**

- Running ZB or Dual-Threat ZB
- Power Flankers, Reliable Flankers
- Mauler O-Line

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
|4-6|0-0.5     |0.5-1.5    |0.5-1   |45-58       |

-----

### 2. Lateral Spread

**Philosophy:** Stretch the defense horizontally. Use 2-4 lateral chains to create space. High-variance offense that lives on big plays.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
weights = {
    'lateral_spread': 0.45,
    'sweep_option': 0.20,
    'speed_option': 0.15,
    'dive_option': 0.10,
    'territory_kick': 0.10,
}
```

**Tendencies:**

- Run-to-lateral ratio: 40/60
- Average chain length: 3.5 laterals
- Snap kick attempts: Moderate (when defense stacks the box)
- Risk tolerance: High—will chain in own territory
- Explosive play rate: High

**Ideal Roster:**

- Distributor ZB
- Speed Flankers, Elusive Flankers
- Receiving Viper
- Screen O-Line

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
|3-5|0.5-1.5   |1-2        |0.5-1   |42-55       |

-----

### 3. Boot Raid

**Philosophy:** The “Air Raid with the foot.” Get to the opponent’s 40-45 (the “Launch Pad”), then start firing snap kicks. Treat the field as a probability grid.

**The Green Zone Concept:**

- Traditional offense wants to reach the Red Zone (inside 20)
- Boot Raid wants to reach the Green Zone (opponent’s 40-45)
- Once in the Green Zone, snap kick EV often exceeds lateral chain EV

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
# Before reaching Launch Pad (own territory to midfield)
weights_approach = {
    'dive_option': 0.35,
    'sweep_option': 0.25,
    'speed_option': 0.20,
    'lateral_spread': 0.15,
    'territory_kick': 0.05,
}

# After reaching Launch Pad (opponent's 45 and in)
weights_attack = {
    'territory_kick': 0.50,      # Snap kicks primary
    'lateral_spread': 0.25,      # Fake kick, lateral to Viper
    'speed_option': 0.15,        # Keeper cheating? Run past them
    'dive_option': 0.10,
}
```

**The “Snap-Fake” Lateral:**

```python
# When defense is in "Zone Keeping" posture
if keeper_position == 'deep' and down <= 4:
    # High probability of snap kick fake into lateral
    snap_fake_probability = 0.35
    if random.random() < snap_fake_probability:
        return 'lateral_spread'  # Viper is already 15 yards downfield
```

**Tendencies:**

- Snap kick attempts: 4-8 per game
- “Launch Pad” trigger: Opponent’s 45-yard line
- Down management: Use 1-2 downs to reach Launch Pad, then attack
- Keeper neutralization: Forces Keeper to play goalie, not safety
- Risk tolerance: Medium—missed kicks are live balls

**Ideal Roster:**

- Kicking ZB (elite, 85+ kicking)
- Speed Flankers who can chase missed kicks
- Decoy Viper to screen Keeper
- Aggressive Keeper on defense

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
|2-3|2-4       |1-2        |1-2     |40-52       |

**The “Triangle” Formation:**

```
        [ZB - 7 yards deep]
           /          \
    [Shield FL]    [Shield FL]
         |              |
    [Sprint VP]   [Sprint FL]
    
- ZB is the "Sniper" - sets up for snap kick
- Shield Flankers protect from rush
- Sprint Viper and Flanker release immediately to uprights
- If kick is blocked or missed, they race Keeper for recovery
```

-----

### 4. Ball Control

**Philosophy:** Conservative, mistake-free football. Use all 6 downs. Never give up Bells. Take the 3-point place kick when available. Win 24-21 by being boring.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
weights = {
    'dive_option': 0.40,
    'power_option': 0.25,
    'sweep_option': 0.20,
    'speed_option': 0.10,
    'lateral_spread': 0.03,      # Almost never
    'territory_kick': 0.02,
}
```

**Tendencies:**

- Run-to-lateral ratio: 95/5
- Lateral chains: Only 2-lateral safe chains
- Snap kick attempts: Almost never (too risky)
- Place kick usage: Primary scoring method when not in red zone
- Clock management: Maximize time of possession
- Risk tolerance: Very low—no chains in own territory

**Ideal Roster:**

- Running ZB
- Power Flankers, Reliable Flankers
- Mauler O-Line

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
|2-3|0-0.3     |2.5-4      |1-2     |32-42       |

-----

### 5. Ghost Formation

**Philosophy:** Use the Viper’s formation exemption to create pre-snap chaos. The defense doesn’t know where the playmaker is until the ball is snapped.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
weights = {
    'viper_motion': 0.30,        # Viper-centric plays
    'lateral_spread': 0.25,
    'sweep_option': 0.20,
    'speed_option': 0.15,
    'dive_option': 0.05,
    'territory_kick': 0.05,
}
```

**The “Confusion Penalty”:**

```python
# Ghost Formation applies defensive debuff
if offensive_style == 'ghost':
    # Defense gets -10% to tackle success on first 2 seconds of play
    if play_time < 2.0:
        defense_tackle_modifier = 0.90
    
    # If defense fails to "shadow" Viper pre-snap
    if not viper_shadowed:
        breakaway_probability += 0.15  # High TD chance
```

**Viper Alignments:**

- “Second Center” — lines up next to ZB, takes direct snap
- “Wide Ghost” — 15 yards outside, sprints on snap
- “Deep Threat” — 10 yards behind ZB, receives pitch on fake kick
- “Blocking Ghost” — in the box, then releases late

**Tendencies:**

- Viper touches per game: 8-12 (highest of any style)
- Pre-snap motion: Every play
- Misdirection rate: High
- Risk tolerance: Medium

**Ideal Roster:**

- Dual-Threat ZB
- Hybrid Viper (the star)
- Speed Flankers
- Versatile O-Line

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
|3-5|0.5-1     |1-2        |0.5-1   |38-52       |

-----

### 6. Rouge Hunt

**Philosophy:** Defense-first offense. Win 18.5 to 12 by stacking Pindowns, forcing Safeties, and generating Bells. Punt early, pin deep, let the opponent make mistakes.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
# Offensive plays (when you have the ball)
weights = {
    'territory_kick': 0.40,      # Punt/kick early for field position
    'dive_option': 0.30,
    'sweep_option': 0.15,
    'speed_option': 0.10,
    'lateral_spread': 0.05,      # Avoid giving up Bells
}
```

**Down Management:**

```python
def rouge_hunt_decision(self):
    # Punt as early as 3rd down if field position is neutral
    if down >= 3 and field_position < 50:
        if can_pin_inside_10():
            return 'punt'  # Go for Pindown (1 pt)
    
    # On opponent's side, consider snap kick for Pindown combo
    if field_position >= 50 and down >= 4:
        # Aim low—if it misses, might still pin them deep
        return 'snap_kick_low'
```

**Tendencies:**

- Punts per game: 8-12 (highest of any style)
- Pindown attempts: Aggressive
- Offensive TDs: Low priority
- Defensive scoring focus: Safeties, Bells
- Time of possession: Doesn’t care—wants opponent to have ball in bad position

**Ideal Roster:**

- Kicking ZB (accuracy over power)
- Reliable Flankers (no fumbles)
- Elite Keeper (the star defender)
- Ball-hawk secondary

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Bells|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|-----|------------|
|1-2|0.5-1     |1-2        |3-5     |2-4  |25-38       |

**Why It Works:**

- Force opponent to start inside their 10 repeatedly
- Opponent takes risks (lateral chains) in their own end zone
- Opponent fumbles = Bell (½ pt) + great field position
- Opponent gets tackled in end zone = Safety (2 pts)
- You “score” while never crossing midfield

-----

### 7. Chain Gang

**Philosophy:** Maximum laterals, maximum chaos. Every play is a 4-5 lateral chain. Either score 9 or fumble trying. The “Showtime Lakers” of Viperball.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
weights = {
    'lateral_spread': 0.60,      # Primary play type
    'speed_option': 0.15,
    'sweep_option': 0.10,
    'dive_option': 0.05,
    'territory_kick': 0.10,
}
```

**Chain Configuration:**

```python
# Chain Gang runs longer chains than other styles
chain_length_weights = {
    2: 0.10,  # Short chain (rare)
    3: 0.25,  # Standard
    4: 0.40,  # Primary
    5: 0.25,  # Full chain
}

# Average chain length: 3.8 (vs 2.8 for other styles)
```

**Tendencies:**

- Lateral chains per game: 25-35 (highest)
- Average chain length: 3.8 laterals
- Fumble risk: Very high
- Big play rate: Very high
- Bell giveaways: 2-4 per game (cost of doing business)

**Ideal Roster:**

- Distributor ZB
- All Speed/Elusive Flankers
- Receiving Viper
- Screen O-Line

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Bells Given|Style Points         |
|---|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
|4-7|0.3-1     |0.5-1      |2-4        |42-65 (high variance)|

-----

### 8. Triple Threat

**Philosophy:** Single-wing misdirection. The snap doesn’t always go to the ZB. Power Flankers take direct snaps. No one knows who has the ball.

**Play Selection Weights:**

```python
weights = {
    'direct_snap_power': 0.25,   # Flanker takes snap, runs
    'dive_option': 0.25,
    'power_option': 0.20,
    'sweep_option': 0.15,
    'lateral_spread': 0.10,
    'territory_kick': 0.05,
}
```

**Ball Distribution:**

```python
# Ball carrier is unpredictable
snap_recipient = {
    'zeroback': 0.50,
    'power_flanker': 0.30,
    'viper': 0.15,
    'wingback': 0.05,
}
```

**Tendencies:**

- Direct snaps to non-ZB: 30-40% of plays
- Misdirection rate: High
- Fumble risk: Low (power carriers, secure ball)
- Yards per play: Medium (4-5)
- Clock control: Excellent

**Ideal Roster:**

- Dual-Threat ZB
- Power Flankers who can take direct snaps
- Power Viper
- Mauler O-Line

**Scoring Profile (per game):**

|TDs|Snap Kicks|Place Kicks|Pindowns|Style Points|
|---|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
|3-4|0.3-0.8   |1.5-2.5    |1-2     |38-48       |

-----

### Playstyle Matchup Matrix

How styles perform against each other (offense vs defense):

|Offense ↓ / Defense →|Contain |Pressure|Bend Don’t Break|Blitz        |
|---------------------|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|
|Ground & Pound       |Neutral |+Offense|−Offense        |High variance|
|Lateral Spread       |−Offense|+Offense|Neutral         |−Offense     |
|Boot Raid            |+Offense|−Offense|−Offense        |Neutral      |
|Ball Control         |+Offense|Neutral |−Offense        |+Offense     |
|Ghost Formation      |+Offense|Neutral |Neutral         |−Offense     |
|Rouge Hunt           |Neutral |−Offense|+Offense        |Neutral      |
|Chain Gang           |−Offense|+Offense|Neutral         |−Offense     |
|Triple Threat        |Neutral |+Offense|−Offense        |Neutral      |

*+Offense = offense has advantage, −Offense = defense has advantage*

### Implementation Notes

**Play Selection Function:**

```python
def select_play(self, style: str, game_state: GameState) -> Play:
    # Get base weights for style
    weights = STYLE_WEIGHTS[style].copy()
    
    # Apply situational modifiers
    weights = self.apply_down_distance_modifiers(weights, game_state)
    weights = self.apply_field_position_modifiers(weights, game_state)
    weights = self.apply_score_modifiers(weights, game_state)
    weights = self.apply_clock_modifiers(weights, game_state)
    
    # Style-specific triggers
    if style == 'boot_raid' and game_state.field_position >= 55:
        # Reached Launch Pad — switch to attack mode
        weights = BOOT_RAID_ATTACK_WEIGHTS.copy()
    
    if style == 'rouge_hunt' and game_state.down >= 3:
        # Consider early punt for Pindown
        weights['territory_kick'] *= 2.0
    
    if style == 'ghost' and not game_state.viper_shadowed:
        # Defense didn't account for Viper — exploit
        weights['viper_motion'] *= 1.5
    
    return weighted_choice(weights)
```

**Keeper Fatigue (for Boot Raid counter):**

```python
def update_keeper_fatigue(self, play_type: str, style: str):
    if style == 'boot_raid':
        # Keeper sprints to uprights on every snap kick
        if play_type in ['snap_kick', 'territory_kick']:
            self.keeper_fatigue += 8
        else:
            self.keeper_fatigue += 2
    else:
        self.keeper_fatigue += 3
    
    # Fatigue affects Keeper performance
    if self.keeper_fatigue > 70:
        self.keeper_tackle_modifier = 0.85
        self.keeper_deflection_modifier = 0.80
```

-----

## Offensive Philosophy (CRITICAL FRAMEWORK)

### Core Principle

Viperball offense is **football without the forward pass**, not a lateral gimmick sport. The lateral chain replaces the passing game, but traditional ground-and-pound running remains the foundation. Teams should have diverse playbooks with runs, laterals, and kicks selected based on situation.

### The Lateral Chain is the Passing Game, Not the Running Game

|Football Concept|Viperball Equivalent         |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
|Inside run      |Dive, Power                  |
|Outside run     |Sweep, Speed Option          |
|Short pass      |2-lateral chain              |
|Medium pass     |3-lateral chain              |
|Deep shot       |4-5 lateral chain            |
|Screen pass     |Screen lateral to Viper      |
|Play action     |Fake lateral, delayed run    |
|Field goal      |Place kick (3 pts)           |
|Hail Mary       |Long chain + snap kick option|

### 6-Down System Maps to 4-Down Football

The AI is currently wasting downs by kicking on 5th down. Here’s the correct mapping:

|Viperball Down|Football Equivalent|Decision                       |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
|1st–3rd down  |1st–2nd down       |Run offense freely             |
|4th–5th down  |3rd down           |Run offense, can get aggressive|
|**6th down**  |**4th down**       |Punt, kick FG, or go for it    |

**Critical fix:** Teams should run normal offense through 5th down. The punt/kick/go-for-it decision happens on **6th down only** (except for snap kicks, which can be attempted anytime due to live-ball recovery rules).

-----

### Play Selection by Situation

#### Short Yardage (1–3 yards to go)

Power football. Don’t risk lateral fumbles when you just need a few yards.

```python
weights = {
    'dive_option': 0.40,     # Straight ahead
    'power_option': 0.30,    # Downhill behind pulling guard
    'sweep_option': 0.15,    # Speed to edge
    'lateral_spread': 0.10,  # Only if defense is stacking box
    'snap_kick': 0.05,       # Only if in range and situation favors it
}
```

#### Medium Yardage (4–10 yards)

Balanced attack. Mix runs and laterals based on defensive look.

```python
weights = {
    'sweep_option': 0.25,
    'speed_option': 0.20,
    'lateral_spread': 0.25,
    'dive_option': 0.15,
    'option': 0.10,
    'snap_kick': 0.05,
}
```

#### Long Yardage (11+ yards)

Need chunk plays. Laterals and speed become primary.

```python
weights = {
    'lateral_spread': 0.40,  # High risk/reward — need the yards
    'speed_option': 0.25,    # Big play potential
    'sweep_option': 0.20,
    'snap_kick': 0.10,       # Take points if in range
    'dive_option': 0.05,     # Won't get 11+ yards on a dive
}
```

#### Red Zone (Inside Opponent’s 20)

Tighter space compresses the field. Less room for lateral chains to develop.

```python
# Boost inside runs, reduce lateral reliance
weights['dive_option'] *= 1.4
weights['power_option'] *= 1.4
weights['lateral_spread'] *= 0.6
```

#### Goal Line (Inside Opponent’s 5)

Pure power football. Lateral chains are too risky this close.

```python
weights = {
    'dive_option': 0.45,
    'power_option': 0.35,
    'option': 0.15,          # ZB keeps on read
    'lateral_spread': 0.05,  # Almost never — one fumble kills you
}
```

-----

### Clock Management

#### Leading, Final 5 Minutes

Run the ball, avoid turnovers, burn clock.

```python
weights['lateral_spread'] *= 0.4   # Cut lateral usage drastically
weights['dive_option'] *= 1.6      # Grind inside
weights['sweep_option'] *= 1.3     # Safe outside runs
weights['snap_kick'] *= 0.3        # Don't give them the ball back
```

#### Trailing, Final 5 Minutes

Need big plays and quick scores.

```python
weights['lateral_spread'] *= 1.5   # Increase explosive play calls
weights['snap_kick'] *= 1.8        # Take shots at 5 points
weights['speed_option'] *= 1.3     # Get to perimeter fast
weights['dive_option'] *= 0.6      # Not enough time for 3-yard gains
```

#### Two-Minute Drill Equivalent

When trailing with under 2 minutes, offense should:

- Prioritize sideline plays to stop clock (sweeps, chains to boundary)
- Attempt snap kicks if in range (5 pts > 3 pts when trailing)
- Never run dives up the middle (clock killer)

-----

### Down-by-Down Decision Framework

#### 1st–3rd Down: “Early Downs”

Run your base offense. Take what the defense gives you. Can take calculated risks because you have 3+ downs remaining.

- Call plays based on distance to go
- Mix runs and laterals to keep defense honest
- Snap kick attempts are fine here (miss isn’t fatal)

#### 4th–5th Down: “Middle Downs”

Still running offense, but be smart. You have cushion but can’t waste plays.

- If short yardage (≤5), lean runs to convert
- If medium/long yardage, lateral chains are appropriate
- **DO NOT punt or place kick on 5th down** (you still have 6th!)
- Snap kicks allowed (live ball recovery makes them low-risk)

#### 6th Down: “Decision Down”

This is your 4th down in football. Make the possession decision here.

```python
def select_6th_down_decision(self):
    fp = self.state.field_position
    ytg = self.state.yards_to_go
    
    # === GO FOR IT ===
    # Short yardage anywhere
    if ytg <= 4:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    # In opponent territory with medium yardage
    if fp >= 55 and ytg <= 8:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    # Red zone — score or turn it over trying
    if fp >= 75:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    # === PLACE KICK (3 pts) ===
    # In FG range, yardage too long to convert
    fg_distance = (100 - fp) + 17
    if fg_distance <= 50 and ytg >= 8:
        return 'place_kick'
    
    # === SNAP KICK (5 pts) ===
    # Longer range, or trailing where 5 > 3 matters
    if fg_distance > 45 and fg_distance <= 55 and self.kicker_skill >= 70:
        return 'snap_kick'
    
    if self.trailing_by(1, 8) and fg_distance <= 52:
        return 'snap_kick'  # 5 points could tie/win, 3 might not
    
    # === PUNT ===
    # Own territory, out of FG range
    if fp < 45:
        return 'punt'
    
    # Default: go for it if nothing else fits
    return 'go_for_it'
```

-----

### Snap Kick Special Rules

**Critical rule:** Missed snap kicks are **live balls**. The kicking team can recover and retain possession.

This changes the EV calculation significantly:

```python
# Old (wrong) — treated miss as turnover
ev_snap_kick = success_rate * 5

# New (correct) — miss has recovery chance
RECOVERY_RATE = 0.35  # Kicking team recovers ~35% of misses

ev_snap_kick = (success_rate * 5) + ((1 - success_rate) * RECOVERY_RATE * continuation_value)
```

**When to attempt snap kicks:**

|Situation                     |Snap Kick?       |Reasoning                           |
|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
|Any down, in range (35–52 yds)|Consider it      |Miss isn’t fatal                    |
|Trailing by 1–8 points        |Yes              |5 pts might tie/win, 3 pts might not|
|6th down, 45–55 yard range    |Yes              |Too long for place kick             |
|Kicking ZB archetype on field |Increase attempts|Specialist should use their skill   |
|Heavy wind                    |Reduce attempts  |Accuracy tanks in wind              |

**Recovery mechanics for missed snap kicks:**

```python
def resolve_missed_snap_kick(self, kick_distance):
    # Determine landing spot
    if missed_wide:
        landing = kick_origin + kick_distance * random.uniform(0.7, 0.9)
    elif missed_short:
        landing = kick_origin + kick_distance * random.uniform(0.4, 0.7)
    
    # Recovery contest
    kicking_team_recovery = 0.35  # Base rate
    if near_sideline:
        kicking_team_recovery += 0.10
    if defense_rushed_kick:
        kicking_team_recovery += 0.05
    
    if random.random() < kicking_team_recovery:
        # Kicking team recovers — Bell (+0.5) and keeps possession
        return Recovery(team="offense", bell=True)
    else:
        # Defense recovers — Bell (+0.5) and gets possession  
        return Recovery(team="defense", bell=True)
```

### Run Play Types

The sim should have diverse run concepts, not just “lateral or not lateral”:

|Play            |Description                   |Avg Yards|Variance |Best Use            |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------|---------|--------------------|
|**Dive**        |Straight ahead behind center  |3.5–4.5  |Low      |Short yardage, clock|
|**Power**       |Pulling guard, downhill       |4.0–5.0  |Medium   |Goal line, need push|
|**Sweep**       |Speed to edge, outside zone   |4.5–6.0  |High     |Perimeter, space    |
|**Speed Option**|ZB reads end, pitch or keep   |5.0–7.0  |High     |Numbers advantage   |
|**Counter**     |Fake one way, run other       |4.0–6.5  |High     |Misdirection        |
|**Draw**        |Fake lateral/kick, delayed run|4.5–7.0  |High     |Catch D cheating    |
|**Viper Jet**   |Viper in motion, quick give   |5.5–8.0  |Very High|Mismatch hunting    |

### Lateral Chain Types

|Chain Length  |Avg Yards|Fumble Risk|Best Use               |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-----------------------|
|**2 laterals**|5–7      |5–6%       |Safe horizontal stretch|
|**3 laterals**|6–9      |8–10%      |Standard “passing” play|
|**4 laterals**|8–12     |12–14%     |Aggressive, need yards |
|**5 laterals**|10–15    |15–18%     |Desperation/explosive  |

-----

### Team Archetype Playcalling Tendencies

|Archetype         |Run %|Lateral %|Snap Kick Rate|Style                      |
|------------------|-----|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
|**Ground & Pound**|70%  |20%      |Low           |Dive, power, control clock |
|**Lateral Spread**|35%  |55%      |Medium        |Chains, speed, space       |
|**Kick Heavy**    |40%  |30%      |High          |Field position, take points|
|**Balanced**      |50%  |35%      |Medium        |Situational, adaptable     |
|**Chaos**         |45%  |45%      |Medium        |High variance, turnovers   |

### Playcalling Decision Tree (Simplified Reference)

The EV system replaces hard-coded rules, but here’s the expected behavior:

-----

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY LIST (v3.8)

Based on diagnostic batch comparing current metrics to targets:

### Current State vs Targets

|Metric       |Current   |Target |Status            |
|-------------|----------|-------|------------------|
|Pindowns/team|1.25      |1-3    |✅ Hitting         |
|TDs/team     |3.12      |3-5    |✅ Low end         |
|Bells/team   |0.00      |2-4    |🔴 Not implemented |

|Drives/team  |0 (broken)|10-12  |🔴 Not tracking    |

-----

### Priority 1: Fix Bells (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Bells (½ point for recovering opponent’s loose ball) are not being tracked or awarded.

**Impact:** Missing 2-4 points per team per game.

**Implementation:**

```python
def check_for_bell(self, play_result, recovering_team, fumbling_team):
    """
    Award Bell (½ point) when a team recovers the OPPONENT's loose ball.
    No Bell for recovering your own fumble.
    One Bell per play maximum.
    """
    
    # Only award if recovering team is NOT the fumbling team
    if recovering_team != fumbling_team:
        self.award_points(recovering_team, 0.5, 'bell')
        self.stats[recovering_team]['bells'] += 1
        self.stats[recovering_team]['bell_points'] += 0.5
        
        self.log(f"BELL! +½ point to {recovering_team} — recovered {fumbling_team}'s fumble")
        
        # Set flag to prevent multiple Bells on same play
        play_result.bell_awarded = True


def resolve_fumble(self, fumble_event):
    """Resolve fumble and check for Bell."""
    
    fumbling_team = fumble_event.team
    
    # Determine recovery
    recovery_chance = 0.50  # Base 50/50
    # Modify by ball location, players nearby, etc.
    
    if random.random() < recovery_chance:

    if recovering_team != fumbling_team:
        self.check_for_bell(fumble_event, recovering_team, fumbling_team)
    
    return recovering_team


def resolve_muffed_punt(self, punt_result):
    """Muffed punt = potential Bell for kicking team."""
    
    muff_chance = self.get_muff_probability(returner)
    
    if random.random() < muff_chance:
        # Determine recovery
        kicking_team_recovery = 0.65  # Kicking team usually recovers muffs

        else:
            # Receiving team recovers own muff — no Bell
            return self.receiving_team
```

**Bell Triggers:**

- Fumble recovered by defense → Bell to defense
- Muffed punt recovered by kicking team → Bell to kicking team
- Blocked kick recovered by blocking team → Bell to blocking team
- Lateral chain fumble recovered by defense → Bell to defense

**NOT a Bell:**

- Recovering your own fumble
- Recovering your own missed snap kick (live ball, but it’s your kick)
- Second fumble on same play (one Bell max)

-----

### Priority 2: Fix Safeties (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Safeties (2 points) are not being awarded when offense is tackled in own end zone.

**Impact:** Missing 0.2-0.6 points per game.

**Implementation:**

```python
def check_for_safety(self, play_result):
    """
    Award Safety (2 points) to defense when:
    - Ball carrier tackled in own end zone
    - Fumble recovered by offense in own end zone
    - Ball goes out of bounds in own end zone (offensive penalty)
    """
    
    # Ball carrier tackled in end zone
    if play_result.ending_field_position <= 0:
        self.award_points(self.defending_team, 2, 'safety')
        self.stats[self.defending_team]['safeties'] += 1
        
        self.log(f"SAFETY! +2 points to {self.defending_team}")
        
        # Safety results in free kick from 20
        self.state.possession = self.defending_team
        self.state.field_position = 20
        self.state.free_kick = True
        
        return True
    
    return False


def resolve_run_play(self, play):
    """Run play resolution with safety check."""
    
    yards = self.calculate_yards(play)
    new_position = self.state.field_position + yards
    
    # Safety check — did they get tackled in their own end zone?
    if new_position <= 0:
        self.check_for_safety(play)
        return
    
    # Normal play resolution...
```

**Safety Triggers:**

- Ball carrier tackled at or behind own goal line
- Fumble in end zone, recovered by offense, then tackled
- Intentional grounding in end zone (if implemented)
- Snap goes out of end zone

-----

### Priority 3: Overhaul Kick Decision Engine

**Problem:** AI under-selects place kicks and snap kicks. EV math doesn’t favor them.

**Fix:** On 6th down in FG range, place kick is the DEFAULT. Don’t let EV math override.

```python
def select_6th_down_decision(self):
    fg_distance = (100 - self.state.field_position) + 17
    ytg = self.state.yards_to_go
    
    # === IN FG RANGE (fg_distance <= 50) ===
    if fg_distance <= 50:
        
        # Very short yardage — go for it
        if ytg <= 2:
            return 'go_for_it'
        
        # Trailing by small margin — snap kick (5 > 3)
        if self.trailing_by(1, 4) and self.kicker_skill >= 75:
            return 'snap_kick'
        
        # DEFAULT: Take the 3 points
        return 'place_kick'
    
    # === OUT OF FG RANGE ===
    
    # Short yardage — go for it
    if ytg <= 4:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    # Medium yardage in opponent territory — consider it
    if self.state.field_position >= 55 and ytg <= 8:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    # Default: punt
    return 'punt'
```

**Snap Kick EV Fix (live ball recovery):**

```python
def calculate_snap_kick_ev(self, fg_distance):
    """
    Snap kicks are LESS risky than the AI thinks because
    missed kicks are live balls with ~35% recovery rate.
    """
    
    success_rate = self.get_snap_kick_success_rate(fg_distance)
    
    # Old (wrong): Miss = turnover
    # ev = success_rate * 5
    
    # New (correct): Miss has recovery chance
    RECOVERY_RATE = 0.35
    miss_rate = 1 - success_rate
    continuation_value = self.get_field_position_value(self.state.field_position)
    
    ev = (success_rate * 5) + (miss_rate * RECOVERY_RATE * continuation_value)
    
    return ev
```

-----

### Priority 4: Reduce Punt Rate

**Problem:** 6.04 punts/team (target 3-5). AI is too conservative.

**Fix:** Increase aggression modifiers + add possession cost to punt EV + hard rule overrides.

```python
# Aggression modifiers — more aggressive than before
AGGRESSION_BY_DOWN = {
    4: 1.40,  # Was 1.15
    5: 1.25,  # Was 1.00
    6: 1.10,  # Was 0.85
}

def calculate_punt_ev(self):
    """
    Punt EV should include possession cost.
    Giving up the ball has real value.
    """
    
    expected_landing = self.calculate_punt_landing()
    opponent_starting_fp = 100 - expected_landing
    opponent_fp_value = self.get_field_position_value(opponent_starting_fp)
    
    pindown_prob = 0.25 if expected_landing <= 10 else 0.0
    
    # OLD (wrong): No possession cost
    # ev = (3.0 - opponent_fp_value) + (pindown_prob * 1)
    
    # NEW: Add possession cost
    POSSESSION_VALUE = 2.5  # Giving up ball costs ~2.5 points EV
    ev = (3.0 - opponent_fp_value) + (pindown_prob * 1) - POSSESSION_VALUE
    
    return ev


def apply_hard_rule_overrides(self, best_option):
    """
    Override EV-based decision in egregious cases.
    """
    
    down = self.state.down
    fp = self.state.field_position
    ytg = self.state.yards_to_go
    fg_distance = (100 - fp) + 17
    
    # NEVER punt before 5th down (unless pinned inside own 10)
    if down <= 4 and fp >= 10:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            return 'go_for_it'
    
    # NEVER punt from opponent's territory on 5th down
    if down == 5 and fp >= 50:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            if fg_distance <= 52:
                return 'place_kick'
            else:
                return 'go_for_it'
    
    # NEVER punt from opponent's 40-in on 6th down
    if down == 6 and fp >= 60:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            return 'place_kick' if fg_distance <= 55 else 'go_for_it'
    
    # ALWAYS go for it on 6th-and-short (≤3 yards)
    if down == 6 and ytg <= 3:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    return best_option
```

-----

### Priority 5: Expand Fumble System to Run Plays

**Problem:** Fumbles only occur on lateral chains. Should occur on ALL ball-carrying plays.

**Impact:** Increases Bell opportunities naturally.

```python
def check_run_fumble(self, play, carrier):
    """
    All ball-carrying plays have fumble risk.
    """
    
    # Base rates by play type
    BASE_FUMBLE_RATES = {
        'dive_option': 0.012,    # 1.2% — safest
        'power_option': 0.014,   # 1.4%
        'sweep_option': 0.018,   # 1.8%
        'speed_option': 0.020,   # 2.0% — riskiest run
    }
    
    fumble_prob = BASE_FUMBLE_RATES.get(play.family, 0.015)
    
    # Modify by carrier Power attribute
    if carrier.power >= 80:
        fumble_prob *= 0.75  # Strong carriers hold on
    elif carrier.power < 50:
        fumble_prob *= 1.15  # Weak carriers lose it
    
    # Modify by fatigue
    if carrier.stamina < 70:
        fumble_prob += 0.025
    
    # Modify by defensive pressure
    if self.defense_style in ['pressure', 'blitz']:
        fumble_prob += 0.015
    
    # Modify by big hit (TFL or loss)
    if play.yards <= 0:
        fumble_prob += 0.030  # Stuffed at line = harder hit
    
    # Weather modifier
    if self.weather in ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet']:
        fumble_prob *= 1.35
    
    # Roll for fumble
    if random.random() < fumble_prob:
        return self.resolve_fumble(play, carrier)
    
    return None
```

**Expected Fumble Distribution:**

|Source        |Plays/Game|Fumble Rate    |Expected Fumbles|
|--------------|----------|---------------|----------------|
|Runs          |35-45     |1.5-2%         |0.5-0.9         |
|Lateral chains|15-20     |6-8% cumulative|1.0-1.6         |
|Returns       |4-6       |3%             |0.1-0.2         |
|**Total/team**|—         |—              |**1.6-2.7**     |

With ~50% defensive recovery rate, that’s 0.8-1.4 Bells per team per game.

-----

### Priority 6: Fix Drive Tracking

**Problem:** Drive counter returning 0.

**Implementation:**

```python
def start_new_drive(self):
    """Initialize drive tracking."""
    
    self.current_drive = {
        'team': self.state.possession,
        'quarter': self.state.quarter,
        'start_field_position': self.state.field_position,
        'start_time': self.state.time_remaining,
        'plays': 0,
        'yards': 0,
        'result': None,
    }
    
    self.stats[self.state.possession]['drives'] += 1


def end_drive(self, result):
    """Finalize drive and record stats."""
    
    self.current_drive['result'] = result
    self.current_drive['plays'] = self.plays_this_drive
    self.current_drive['yards'] = self.yards_this_drive
    
    self.drive_log.append(self.current_drive)
    
    # Categorize drive outcome
    if result == 'touchdown':
        self.stats[self.current_drive['team']]['td_drives'] += 1
    elif result in ['place_kick', 'snap_kick']:
        self.stats[self.current_drive['team']]['fg_drives'] += 1
    elif result == 'punt':
        self.stats[self.current_drive['team']]['punt_drives'] += 1
    elif result == 'fumble':
        self.stats[self.current_drive['team']]['turnover_drives'] += 1
```

### Expected Metrics After All Fixes

|Metric       |Current|After Fixes|Target |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-------|
|Bells/team   |0.00   |1.5-2.5    |2-4    |
|Safeties/team|0.00   |0.1-0.2    |0.1-0.3|

## RUN GAME SPECIFICATION (Priority 7 - After Scoring Fixes)

The current run game is functional but simplified. This section specifies the full implementation to match the offensive philosophy.

### Current State

**What exists:**

- 3 run families: Dive Option (μ5.5, σ3.5), Speed Option (μ6.3, σ4.5), Sweep Option (μ5.7, σ5.0)
- Modifiers: archetype, weather, team speed, fatigue, style bonuses, field position, defensive scheme
- Explosive play bonus system
- `_run_fumble_check` exists
- Defensive read system (12-30% yard reduction)
- Ball carrier: `random.choice(team.players[:5])` — not positional

**What’s missing:**

1. Only 3 run types (need 7)
1. No positional ball carrier selection
1. No gap/tackle mechanics
1. No run-specific defensive matchups
1. Base yards inflated (5.5-6.3 vs 3.5-5.0 target)
1. No TFL fumble boost

-----

### Run Play Types (Expand from 3 to 7)

|Play            |Base Yards|Variance (σ)|Description                   |Primary Carrier        |
|----------------|----------|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
|**Dive**        |3.5-4.5   |2.5         |Straight ahead, low variance  |Halfback, Power Flanker|
|**Power**       |4.0-5.0   |3.0         |Pulling guard, downhill       |Power Flanker, Halfback|
|**Sweep**       |4.5-6.0   |4.5         |Outside run, speed to edge    |Speed Flanker, Wingback|
|**Speed Option**|5.0-7.0   |5.0         |ZB reads end, pitch or keep   |ZB, Wingback           |
|**Counter**     |4.0-6.5   |5.0         |Fake one way, run other       |Any Flanker            |

### Positional Ball Carrier Selection

**Replace** `random.choice(team.players[:5])` with position-aware selection:

```python
def select_ball_carrier(self, play_type: str, team: Team) -> Player:
    """
    Select ball carrier based on play type and available personnel.
    """
    
    config = RUN_PLAY_CONFIG[play_type]
    primary_positions = config['primary_carriers']
    
    # Find eligible carriers by position
    eligible = []
    for player in team.offensive_players:
        if player.position_code in primary_positions:
            eligible.append(player)
    
    # If no primary carriers available, fall back to any ball carrier
    if not eligible:
        eligible = [p for p in team.offensive_players if p.can_carry_ball]
    
    # Weight by archetype fit
    weights = []
    for player in eligible:
        weight = 1.0
        
        # Archetype bonuses
        if play_type == 'dive' and player.archetype == 'Power Flanker':

        weights.append(weight)
    
    # Weighted random selection
    return random.choices(eligible, weights=weights, k=1)[0]

### Gap/Tackle Mechanics

**Replace** flat defensive modifier with structured defensive resolution:

    Defensive resolution with gap breakdown, tackle attempts, and 1-on-1s.

### Run-Specific Defensive Matchup Matrix

How defensive schemes perform against run-heavy offensive styles:

```python
DEFENSE_VS_OFFENSE_RUN_MATRIX = {
    # (defense_scheme, offensive_style): yards_modifier

### TFL Fumble Boost

**Add** to existing `_run_fumble_check`:

```python
def _run_fumble_check(self, play, carrier, yards):
    """
    Check for fumble on run play.
    Getting stuffed at the line increases fumble risk.
    """
    
    config = RUN_PLAY_CONFIG[play.family]
    fumble_prob = config['fumble_rate']
    
    # === TFL FUMBLE BOOST ===
    if yards <= 0:
        # Stuffed at line = harder hit = more fumbles
        fumble_prob += 0.035  # +3.5%
    elif yards <= 2:
        # Short gain, still took a hit
        fumble_prob += 0.015  # +1.5%
    
    # Carrier Power attribute
    if carrier.power >= 80:
        fumble_prob *= 0.75
    elif carrier.power < 50:
        fumble_prob *= 1.20
    
    # Fatigue
    if carrier.current_stamina < 60:
        fumble_prob += 0.020
    
    # Weather
    if self.weather in ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet']:
        fumble_prob *= 1.35
    
    # Defensive pressure
    if self.defense_style in ['pressure', 'blitz']:
        fumble_prob += 0.012
    
    # Roll
    if random.random() < fumble_prob:
        return self.resolve_fumble(play, carrier)
    
    return None
```

-----

### Adjusted Base Yards (Lower Averages, More Variance)

**Current:** μ5.5-6.3 yards (too high)
**Target:** μ3.5-5.0 yards base, with explosive plays adding chunk gains

```python
# OLD base yards (inflated)
DIVE_BASE = random.gauss(5.5, 3.5)
SPEED_BASE = random.gauss(6.3, 4.5)
SWEEP_BASE = random.gauss(5.7, 5.0)

# NEW base yards (realistic with explosive system)
def calculate_base_yards(self, play_type: str) -> float:
    config = RUN_PLAY_CONFIG[play_type]
    
    # Random base within range
    base_min, base_max = config['base_yards']
    base = random.uniform(base_min, base_max)
    
    # Add variance
    variance = config['variance']
    yards = random.gauss(base, variance)
    
    # Floor at -5 (big TFL)
    return max(-5, yards)
```

**Expected Yards Per Play Distribution:**

|Play Type   |25th %ile|Median|75th %ile|95th %ile (Explosive)|
|------------|---------|------|---------|---------------------|
|Dive        |2        |4     |6        |10                   |
|Power       |2        |5     |7        |12                   |
|Sweep       |1        |5     |8        |15                   |
|Speed Option|0        |5     |9        |18                   |
|Counter     |1        |5     |9        |16                   |
|Draw        |2        |6     |10       |20                   |
|Viper Jet   |0        |6     |11       |22                   |

Lower floor, higher ceiling. Averages come down but big plays still happen.

-----

### Implementation Priority

This is **Priority 7** — implement after scoring fixes (Bells, Safeties, Kicks, Punts, Fumbles, Drives).

**Order within run game upgrade:**

1. Add 4 new run types (Power, Counter, Draw, Viper Jet)
1. Implement positional ball carrier selection
1. Lower base yards, adjust variance
1. Add TFL fumble boost
1. Add gap/tackle mechanics
1. Add defensive matchup matrix

## STAT TRACKING REQUIREMENTS (v3.10)

### Missing: Rushing vs Lateral Yards

**Current:** All yards go into generic `game_yards` field per player. No distinction between rushing and lateral receiving.

**Fix:** Track separately:

```python
class PlayerGameStats:
    def __init__(self):
        # Rushing stats (from run plays)
        self.rushing_attempts = 0
        self.rushing_yards = 0
        self.rushing_tds = 0
        self.rushing_fumbles = 0
        self.rushing_long = 0
        
        # Lateral receiving stats (from lateral chains)
        self.lateral_receptions = 0
        self.lateral_yards = 0        # Yards after catch
        self.lateral_tds = 0
        self.lateral_fumbles = 0
        self.lateral_assists = 0      # Pitched to teammate who gained yards
        self.lateral_long = 0
        
        # Combined (for backward compatibility)
        self.total_touches = 0
        self.total_yards = 0
        self.total_tds = 0


def record_run_play(self, carrier, yards, is_td):
    carrier.stats.rushing_attempts += 1
    carrier.stats.rushing_yards += yards
    carrier.stats.rushing_long = max(carrier.stats.rushing_long, yards)
    carrier.stats.total_touches += 1
    carrier.stats.total_yards += yards
    if is_td:
        carrier.stats.rushing_tds += 1
        carrier.stats.total_tds += 1


def record_lateral_chain(self, chain_players, yards_by_player, final_td):
    """
    Record lateral chain stats with assists.
    
    chain_players: list of players in order [pitcher, catcher, catcher, ...]
    yards_by_player: dict of {player: yards_gained_while_carrying}
    """
    for i, player in enumerate(chain_players):
        player_yards = yards_by_player.get(player, 0)
        
        # Everyone except the last player gets an assist
        if i < len(chain_players) - 1:
            player.stats.lateral_assists += 1
        
        # Everyone except the first player gets a reception
        if i > 0:
            player.stats.lateral_receptions += 1
            player.stats.lateral_yards += player_yards
            player.stats.lateral_long = max(player.stats.lateral_long, player_yards)
            player.stats.total_touches += 1
            player.stats.total_yards += player_yards
        
        # TD goes to final carrier
        if final_td and i == len(chain_players) - 1:
            player.stats.lateral_tds += 1
            player.stats.total_tds += 1
```

### Lateral Assists (Like Hockey/Basketball)

In football, passing yards go to the QB. In Viperball, laterals go backward—the catcher gains the yards, not the thrower.

**The right model is hockey/basketball assists + yards after catch:**

|Player Role                |Gets Credit For                      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|Pitcher (threw the lateral)|**Lateral Assist**                   |
|Catcher (received and ran) |**Lateral Yards** (yards after catch)|

**Example: 4-lateral chain for 35 yards, TD**

```
ZB7 → WB5 → VP1 → HB3 → 35 yards, TD

| Player | Lat Ast | Lat Rec | Lat Yds | TD |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| ZB7    | 1       | 0       | 0       | 0   |
| WB5    | 1       | 1       | 8       | 0   |
| VP1    | 1       | 1       | 12      | 0   |
| HB3    | 0       | 1       | 15      | 1   |
```

- **ZB7** gets an assist (started chain) but no yards (pitched immediately)
- **WB5, VP1** get assists AND yards (caught, ran, pitched)
- **HB3** gets yards and TD (final carrier, no assist)

**This creates new stat leaders:**

|Category             |Description                    |Key Players                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Assist Leaders       |Players who start/extend chains|Distributor ZB, Hybrid Viper   |
|Lateral Yards Leaders|Playmakers who gain YAC        |Speed Flankers, Receiving Viper|
|Lateral TD Leaders   |Finishers who cap drives       |Any skill player               |

-----

### Missing: Kicking Stats Detail

**Current:** `kick_att`, `kick_made` — no distinction between PK and DK.

**Fix:**

```python
class PlayerKickingStats:
    def __init__(self):
        # Place kicks
        self.pk_attempts = 0
        self.pk_made = 0
        self.pk_long = 0          # Longest made
        self.pk_blocked = 0
        
        # Snap kicks (drop kicks)  
        self.dk_attempts = 0
        self.dk_made = 0
        self.dk_long = 0
        self.dk_blocked = 0
        
        # Punting
        self.punt_attempts = 0
        self.punt_yards = 0
        self.punt_avg = 0
        self.punt_long = 0
        self.punt_inside_20 = 0
        self.punt_inside_10 = 0   # Pindown opportunities
        self.punt_touchbacks = 0
        self.punt_blocked = 0
        self.pindowns = 0         # Actually awarded (inside 10, not touchback)
        
        # Kickoffs
        self.kickoff_attempts = 0
        self.kickoff_touchbacks = 0
        self.kickoff_avg_return = 0  # Opponent's avg return yds
```

### Implementation: Auto-Select from Existing Roster

## IMPLEMENTATION SPEC: REMAINING FEATURES (v3.12)

This section covers features defined in earlier versions but not yet implemented.

-----

### TIER 1: GAMEPLAY FEEL (High Impact)

-----

#### 1.1 Carrier Selection by Play Type

**Current:** `random.choice(team.players[:5])` — no positional logic

**Target:** Each play type has preferred carrier positions based on the play’s requirements.

```python
CARRIER_BY_PLAY = {
    'dive': {
        'positions': ['HB', 'PF', 'ZB'],
        'weights': [0.45, 0.35, 0.20],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Power Flanker': 1.3, 'Reliable Flanker': 1.2},
    },
    'power': {
        'positions': ['PF', 'HB'],
        'weights': [0.60, 0.40],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Power Flanker': 1.4},
    },
    'sweep': {
        'positions': ['SF', 'WB', 'EF'],
        'weights': [0.40, 0.35, 0.25],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Speed Flanker': 1.4, 'Elusive Flanker': 1.3},
    },
    'speed_option': {
        'positions': ['ZB', 'SF', 'WB'],
        'weights': [0.35, 0.35, 0.30],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Running ZB': 1.3, 'Dual-Threat ZB': 1.2},
    },
    'counter': {
        'positions': ['WB', 'HB', 'VP'],
        'weights': [0.35, 0.35, 0.30],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Elusive Flanker': 1.3, 'Hybrid Viper': 1.2},
    },
    'draw': {
        'positions': ['HB', 'ZB'],
        'weights': [0.55, 0.45],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Running ZB': 1.2},
    },
    'viper_jet': {
        'positions': ['VP'],
        'weights': [1.0],
        'archetype_bonus': {'Receiving Viper': 1.3, 'Hybrid Viper': 1.4},
    },
}


def select_ball_carrier(self, play_type: str, team: Team) -> Player:
    """Select carrier based on play type, position, and archetype."""
    
    config = CARRIER_BY_PLAY[play_type]
    
    # Get eligible players by position
    eligible = []
    weights = []
    
    for i, pos in enumerate(config['positions']):
        players_at_pos = team.get_players_by_position(pos)
        for player in players_at_pos:
            eligible.append(player)
            
            # Base weight from position priority
            weight = config['weights'][i]
            
            # Archetype bonus
            if player.archetype in config.get('archetype_bonus', {}):
                weight *= config['archetype_bonus'][player.archetype]
            
            # Fatigue penalty
            if player.current_fatigue > 70:
                weight *= 0.6
            elif player.current_fatigue > 50:
                weight *= 0.8
            
            weights.append(weight)
    
    # Fallback if no eligible players
    if not eligible:
        return random.choice(team.skill_players)
    
    # Normalize and select
    total = sum(weights)
    weights = [w / total for w in weights]
    
    return random.choices(eligible, weights=weights, k=1)[0]
```

-----

#### 1.2 Explosive Run System

**Current:** Yards are gaussian with modifiers — no breakaway mechanic

**Target:** 8-28% chance of explosive play by play type, with Keeper matchup resolution.

```python
EXPLOSIVE_CHANCE_BY_PLAY = {
    'dive': 0.08,           # Capped by traffic
    'power': 0.10,          # Downhill momentum

    'counter': 0.20,        # Defense going wrong way
    'draw': 0.12,           # Catches D flat-footed
    'viper_jet': 0.28,      # Highest — Viper in space
    'lateral_chain': 0.22,  # Multiple pitch points

        gain_pct = random.uniform(0.50, 0.85)
        return yards_at_break + int(remaining_field * gain_pct)
```

**Expected Distribution:**

|Play Type   |Avg Yards|Explosive Rate|Avg Explosive Gain|
|------------|---------|--------------|------------------|
|Dive        |4.0      |8%            |18                |

|Speed Option|5.0      |15%           |25                |
|Counter     |5.0      |20%           |30                |
|Draw        |5.5      |12%           |24                |
|Viper Jet   |6.5      |28%           |35                |

#### 1.3 Play-Specific Signatures

**Current:** All plays use same yard calculation with different base means

**Target:** Each play has a unique mechanical signature that affects outcomes.

```python
def apply_play_signature(self, play_type, base_yards, game_state):
    """
    Apply play-specific mechanics that make each play feel distinct.

        # High upside already handled by explosive system
        # Here we add the "bust" side — higher variance
        variance = random.uniform(0.6, 1.4)
        return base_yards * variance
    
    return base_yards
```

-----

#### 1.4 Viper Jet (7th Run Type)

**Current:** Not implemented as distinct play type

**Target:** Add Viper Jet as highest-risk, highest-reward run play.

```python
# Add to play family config
PLAY_FAMILIES['viper_jet'] = {
    'base_yards': (5.0, 8.0),
    'variance': 6.5,
    'fumble_rate': 0.028,  # Highest — speed play, less secure
    'primary_carriers': ['VP'],
    'description': 'Viper in jet motion takes handoff at full speed',
    'explosive_chance': 0.28,
}


def simulate_viper_jet(self, team):
    """

    base = random.uniform(5.0, 8.0)
    yards = random.gauss(base, 6.5)
    
    # Apply Viper-specific modifiers
    if viper.speed >= 90:
        yards += 2
    if viper.archetype == 'Hybrid Viper':

    elif viper.archetype == 'Receiving Viper':
        yards += 1
    
    # Check for catastrophic bust (jet timing off)
    if random.random() < 0.08:
        # Botched exchange or bad timing
        yards = random.uniform(-3, 1)
    
    # Apply explosive check
    yards = self.check_explosive_run(viper, 'viper_jet', yards)
    
    # Fumble check (elevated rate)
    fumble = self.check_fumble(viper, 'viper_jet', yards)
    
    return PlayResult(
        yards=yards,
        carrier=viper,

        play_type='viper_jet'
    )
```

-----

### TIER 2: STRATEGIC DEPTH

-----

#### 2.1 Viper Alignment Advantage

**Current:** Viper alignment is cosmetic — no gameplay effect

**Target:** Where Viper lines up pre-snap affects run success to opposite side.

```python
VIPER_ALIGNMENTS = ['left', 'right', 'slot_left', 'slot_right', 'backfield', 'motion']


def calculate_viper_alignment_bonus(self, play_direction, viper_alignment):
    """
    Viper pulls defenders. Running opposite to Viper alignment = advantage.
    """
    
    ALIGNMENT_BONUS = {
        # (viper_alignment, play_direction): yards_modifier
        ('left', 'right'): 0.18,       # Viper left, run right = big advantage
        ('right', 'left'): 0.18,
        ('slot_left', 'right'): 0.12,
        ('slot_right', 'left'): 0.12,
        ('left', 'left'): -0.05,       # Running into traffic
        ('right', 'right'): -0.05,

    modifier = self.calculate_viper_alignment_bonus(play_direction, viper_alignment)
    
    return base_yards * (1 + modifier)
```

-----

#### 2.2 Defensive Alignment vs Play Type

**Current:** Defense applies flat modifier regardless of alignment

**Target:** Rock-paper-scissors between defensive and offensive play types.

```python
DEFENSE_ALIGNMENT_VS_PLAY = {
    # Spread defense — weak inside, strong outside
    ('spread', 'dive'): +0.20,
    ('spread', 'power'): +0.15,

    ('aggressive', 'speed_option'): +0.15,
    ('aggressive', 'counter'): +0.25, # Bites hard on misdirection
    ('aggressive', 'draw'): +0.30,    # Gets destroyed
    ('aggressive', 'viper_jet'): +0.20,

-----

#### 2.3 Keeper Matchup System

#### 2.4 Run-Specific Fumble Rates + TFL Boost

**Current:** All runs use same fumble rate

**Target:** Each play type has different base fumble rate, plus boost on TFLs.

```python

## KICK FREQUENCY ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Current vs Target

|Metric          |Current|Target |Gap     |
|----------------|-------|-------|--------|
|PK attempts/team|0.94   |2-3    |-50%    |
|PK makes/team   |0.67   |1.5-2.5|-55%    |
|DK attempts/team|0.57   |1-2    |-50%    |
|DK makes/team   |0.33   |0.5-1.5|-50%    |
|Punts/team      |6.37   |3-5    |+30-100%|

### Root Cause Chain

```
Punt rate too high (6.37 vs 3-5 target)
    ↓
Teams give up ball before reaching kick range
    ↓
Fewer opportunities to attempt PK/DK
    ↓
Kick frequency stays low
    ↓
Points stay low (37 vs 40-60 target)
```

**The punt rate is the upstream blocker.** Fix punting, and kicks rise naturally.

### Specific Code Issues

**Issue 1: Aggression modifiers too conservative**

```python
# CURRENT (line ~1441-1444)
aggression = {4: 1.00, 5: 0.95, 6: 0.90}

# TARGET (from v3.7 guide)
aggression = {4: 1.40, 5: 1.25, 6: 1.10}
```

**Issue 2: Snap kick “shot plays” almost never fire**

```python
# CURRENT
snap_kick_shot_chance = 0.03  # 3% base, 5% for Kicking ZB
# Result: 97% of early downs never consider snap kick

# TARGET
snap_kick_shot_chance = 0.08  # 8% base
if zb.archetype == 'Kicking ZB':
    snap_kick_shot_chance = 0.15  # 15% for specialists
if field_position >= 55:  # In range
    snap_kick_shot_chance *= 1.5  # Boost when in Green Zone
```

**Issue 3: Punt EV missing possession cost**

```python
# CURRENT
ev_punt = field_position_value_gained + pindown_value

# TARGET — add possession cost
POSSESSION_COST = 2.5
ev_punt = field_position_value_gained + pindown_value - POSSESSION_COST
```

**Issue 4: Hard rule overrides fire too late**

The place kick overrides on lines 1199-1211 are correct, but teams punt before reaching those field positions. The fix is upstream (reduce punting), not in the override logic.

### Fix Sequence

```
1. Increase aggression modifiers (1.40 / 1.25 / 1.10)
       ↓
2. Add possession cost to punt EV (-2.5)
       ↓
3. Add hard rule: never punt from opponent's territory on 5th down
       ↓
   Punt rate drops from 6.37 → 4.0-5.0
       ↓
   More drives reach opponent's 40-yard line
       ↓
4. Boost snap kick shot play chance (8% base, 15% for Kicking ZB)
       ↓
   PK/DK attempts rise to 2-3 per team
       ↓
   Points rise from 37 → 42-48
```

### Expected Metrics After Fix

|Metric          |Current|After Fix|Target   |
|----------------|-------|---------|---------|
|Punts/team      |6.37   |4.0-4.8  |3-5 ✓    |
|PK attempts/team|0.94   |2.0-2.8  |2-3 ✓    |
|PK makes/team   |0.67   |1.5-2.1  |1.5-2.5 ✓|
|DK attempts/team|0.57   |1.2-1.8  |1-2 ✓    |
|DK makes/team   |0.33   |0.6-1.0  |0.5-1.5 ✓|
|Points/team     |37.3   |42-48    |40-60 ✓  |

### Bug 1: Place Kicks Almost Never Happen

**Current:** 0.01 place kicks per team per game
**Target:** 1.5–2.5 per team per game

**Diagnosis (from 20-game batch):**

- Only 27 out of 171 sixth-down decisions happen in FG range
- Of those 27: 10 chose go-for-it, 9 chose punt, 6 chose snap kick, only 2 chose place kick
- The EV math is wrong—place kick loses to go-for-it when `ytg` is short, loses to punt when `ytg` is long
- Place kick only “wins” in a narrow band that rarely occurs

**Root Cause:** The EV calculation treats place kick as just another option. It should be the **default safe option** on 6th down in FG range.

**Fix:** Override EV calculation on 6th down in FG range:

```python
def select_6th_down_decision(self):
    fg_distance = (100 - field_position) + 17
    
    # === 6TH DOWN IN FG RANGE = TAKE THE POINTS ===
    if fg_distance <= 50:
        # Only go for it if VERY short yardage (1-2 yards)
        if ytg <= 2:
            return 'go_for_it'
        
        # Snap kick only if trailing and 5 > 3 matters
        if self.trailing_by(1, 4) and self.kicker_skill >= 75:
            return 'snap_kick'
        
        # DEFAULT: Take the 3 points. Don't overthink it.
        return 'place_kick'
    
    # === OUT OF FG RANGE ===
    if ytg <= 4:
        return 'go_for_it'
    
    return 'punt'
```

**Philosophy:** 6th down in FG range = take the points. The place kick is “cheap points on a stalled drive”—that’s the whole point. Don’t let EV math talk you out of guaranteed points.

-----

### Bug 2: Pindowns Not Being Awarded

**Current:** 0.2 pindowns per game
**Target:** 2–4 per game

**Diagnosis:**

- Punt landing distribution is correct: 28% inside the 10, 38% inside the 20
- But pindowns aren’t being scored
- The detection/award logic isn’t firing after punt resolution

**Root Cause:** Bug in pindown detection after punt simulation.

**Fix:** Verify this code path exists and fires correctly:

```python
def resolve_punt(self, punt_result):
    landing_spot = punt_result.landing_yard_line
    is_touchback = punt_result.touchback
    
    # === PINDOWN CHECK — THIS MUST FIRE ===
    if landing_spot <= 10 and not is_touchback:
        # Award pindown to kicking team
        self.award_points(self.kicking_team, 1, 'pindown')
        self.stats[self.kicking_team]['pindowns'] += 1
        
        self.log(f"PINDOWN! +1 point — opponent starts at {landing_spot}")
    
    # Set opponent's starting field position
    opponent_fp = landing_spot if not is_touchback else 20
    self.state.field_position = opponent_fp
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Is `award_points()` being called with `'pindown'` type?
- [ ] Is the point being added to the team’s score?
- [ ] Is `stats['pindowns']` being incremented?
- [ ] Is the pindown showing up in game logs/box scores?
- [ ] Is the touchback check correct (ball in end zone = touchback, no pindown)?

### Bug 3: Punt Rate (ACTUALLY FINE)

**Current:** 6.4 punts/game = ~28% of drives
**Target:** 25–35%

This is within range. Earlier measurement of “20%” was likely calculated incorrectly (different denominator).

-----

### Expected Metrics After Fixes

|Metric          |Before Fix|After Fix|Target   |
|----------------|----------|---------|---------|
|Place kicks/team|0.01      |1.5–2.5  |1.5–2.5 ✓|

### Current Problem

Based on 30-game validation batch:

- **Punt rate: 43.9%** (target: 25–35%)
- **Turnover on downs: 0%** — teams NEVER exhaust all 6 downs
- **Scoring drive rate: 26%** (target: 40–55%)
- **Points/team: 27.6** (target: 40–60)
- **Red zone TD rate: 74.9%** — finishing is fine, GETTING there is the problem

The AI is far too conservative. With 6 downs to gain 20 yards, teams should sustain drives and go for it more often. The EV calculation overvalues punts and undervalues going for it.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Punt EV is too high** — Doesn’t adequately penalize giving up possession
1. **Go-for-it EV is too low** — Continuation value underweighted
1. **Aggression modifiers too conservative** — Even 6th down is too punt-happy
1. **No hard floors** — AI will punt on 4th down from opponent’s 45

### Fix 1: Increase Aggression Modifiers

```python
# OLD — too conservative
aggression = {4: 1.15, 5: 1.0, 6: 0.85}

# NEW — much more aggressive
aggression = {4: 1.40, 5: 1.25, 6: 1.10}
```

Even on 6th down, going for it should be viable in most situations. You have 6 downs for a reason—use them.

### Fix 2: Add Possession Cost to Punt EV

Punting surrenders possession. That has real cost that wasn’t being captured:

```python
# OLD
ev_punt = (3.0 - opponent_fp_value) + (pindown_prob * 1)

# NEW — add possession cost penalty
POSSESSION_VALUE = 2.5  # Giving up the ball costs ~2.5 points of EV
ev_punt = (3.0 - opponent_fp_value) + (pindown_prob * 1) - POSSESSION_VALUE
```

This makes punting a last resort, not a default.

### Fix 3: Boost Continuation Value for Go-For-It

The value of converting isn’t just the next first down—it’s the full drive potential:

```python
# OLD
continuation_value = self.field_position_value(new_fp_if_convert)
ev_go_for_it = conversion_rate * continuation_value

# NEW — factor in full drive scoring potential
continuation_value = self.field_position_value(new_fp_if_convert)
expected_drive_points = self.expected_points_from_position(new_fp_if_convert)
ev_go_for_it = conversion_rate * (continuation_value + expected_drive_points * 0.6)
```

**Expected Points by Field Position (for reference):**

|Field Position|Expected Points|
|--------------|---------------|
|Own 1–10      |0.5            |
|Own 11–25     |1.2            |
|Own 26–40     |2.0            |
|Own 41–50     |2.8            |
|Opp 49–40     |3.5            |
|Opp 39–25     |4.5            |
|Opp 24–10     |5.8            |
|Opp 9–1       |7.5            |

### Fix 4: Hard Rules (Override EV in Edge Cases)

```python
def select_kick_decision(self):
    # ... EV calculations ...
    
    best_option = max(options, key=options.get)
    
    # === HARD RULE OVERRIDES ===
    
    # NEVER punt before 5th down unless pinned inside own 10
    if down <= 4 and fp >= 10:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            best_option = 'go_for_it'
    
    # NEVER punt from opponent's territory on 5th down
    if down == 5 and fp >= 50:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            if fg_distance <= 52:
                best_option = 'place_kick'
            else:
                best_option = 'go_for_it'
    
    # NEVER punt from opponent's 40-in on 6th down
    if down == 6 and fp >= 60:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            best_option = 'place_kick' if fg_distance <= 55 else 'go_for_it'
    
    # ALWAYS go for it on 6th down if yards_to_go <= 3
    if down == 6 and ytg <= 3:
        best_option = 'go_for_it'
    
    # ALWAYS go for it on 4th down if yards_to_go <= 2 and past own 30
    if down == 4 and ytg <= 2 and fp >= 30:
        best_option = 'go_for_it'
    
    return type_map[best_option]
```

### Fix 5: Go-For-It Threshold Matrix

When EV is close, use this matrix as tiebreaker:

|Field Position|4th Down Go-For-It If:|5th Down Go-For-It If:|6th Down Go-For-It If:|
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|Own 1–15      |ytg ≤ 1               |ytg ≤ 2               |ytg ≤ 3               |
|Own 16–30     |ytg ≤ 2               |ytg ≤ 4               |ytg ≤ 6               |
|Own 31–45     |ytg ≤ 3               |ytg ≤ 6               |ytg ≤ 10              |
|Own 46–50     |ytg ≤ 5               |ytg ≤ 8               |ytg ≤ 12              |
|Opp 49–40     |ytg ≤ 6               |ytg ≤ 10              |Always (or FG)        |
|Opp 39–25     |ytg ≤ 4               |ytg ≤ 8 (or FG)       |FG or go for it       |
|Opp 24–1      |ytg ≤ 3               |Always (or FG)        |FG or go for it       |

### Fix 6: Yards Per Play Boost (If Still Stalling)

If drives are stalling because they can’t stay on schedule (3.33 yds/play needed):

```python
# Option A: Boost base yards
YARDS_PER_PLAY_MODIFIER = 1.15  # +15% yards on all plays

# Option B: Reduce negative plays
NEGATIVE_PLAY_REDUCTION = 0.70  # 30% fewer TFLs/losses

# Option C: Boost by play type
yards_boost = {
    'dive_option': 1.10,      # 3.2 → 3.5 avg
    'sweep_option': 1.12,     # 4.0 → 4.5 avg
    'speed_option': 1.12,     # 4.2 → 4.7 avg
    'lateral_spread': 1.08,   # 5.5 → 5.9 avg
}
```

### Expected Impact After Fixes

|Metric             |Current|After Fix|Target  |
|-------------------|-------|---------|--------|
|Punt rate          |43.9%  |28–34%   |25–35% ✓|
|Turnover on downs  |0%     |4–7%     |3–6% ✓  |
|Scoring drive %    |26%    |42–52%   |40–55% ✓|
|TDs/game (combined)|4.3    |6.5–8.5  |6–10 ✓  |
|Points/team        |27.6   |40–50    |40–60 ✓ |

### Implementation Priority

1. **Fix 1 + Fix 2** — Adjust aggression modifiers and add possession cost to punt EV
1. **Fix 4** — Add hard rule overrides for egregious punting situations
1. **Fix 3** — Boost continuation value in go-for-it EV
1. **Fix 6** — Only if still stalling after above fixes

### Validation After Implementation

Run 30+ game batch and verify:

- Punt rate: 25–35%
- At least SOME turnover on downs (3–7% of drives)
- Scoring drives: 40%+
- Points/team: 38+

If punt rate drops below 20%, reduce aggression modifiers slightly. The goal is aggressive but not reckless.

**1st–3rd down:**

- Almost never punt unless pinned inside own 5
- Run offense based on scheme and personnel

**4th down:**

- Own 0–30: Punt (unless desperate)
- Own 30–45: Situational (game state, score, time)
- Own 45–Opp 45: Go for it (6 downs is forgiving)
- Opp 45–35: Consider snapkick if Kicking ZB
- Opp 35–25: Place kick or snapkick consideration
- Opp 25–0: Go for TD, place kick if stalled

**5th down:**

- Own 0–35: Punt
- Own 35–Opp 40: Go for it
- Opp 40–30: Snapkick range (Kicking ZB) or go for it
- Opp 30–0: Place kick or go for TD

**6th down:**

- Own 0–25: Punt (desperation only)
- Own 25–Opp 45: Go for it
- Opp 45–35: Place kick (long) or go for it
- Opp 35–0: Place kick

### Archetype-Specific Adjustments

**Kick-Heavy Teams:**

- Attempt snapkicks starting at opponent’s 45
- Prefer place kicks to TD attempts when inside 30
- Punt earlier to play field position game
- Run prevent-style defense when leading

**TD-Heavy Teams:**

- Go for it on 5th/6th down more aggressively
- Rarely attempt snapkicks
- Place kicks only when TD is unlikely
- Aggressive defense to force turnovers

**Balanced Teams:**

- Standard decision tree
- Adapt to game state

### Game State Modifiers

|Situation                   |Adjustment                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|Trailing by 10+             |+25% go-for-it rate, +20% snapkick attempts|
|Leading by 10+              |+20% punt/FG rate, conservative            |
|Final 5 min, trailing       |Almost never punt, aggressive kicks        |
|Final 5 min, leading        |Run clock, take points when available      |
|Final 2 min, trailing by 3–8|Snapkicks become premium (5 > 3)           |

|PROV|3  |1        |2          |0       |1       |1.5  |38   |

**BC Drive Summary:**

1. 6 plays, 58 yds → TD (9)
1. 5 plays, 42 yds → Place Kick 28 yds GOOD (3)
1. 4 plays, 31 yds → Fumble lost
1. 7 plays, 75 yds → TD (9)
1. 3 plays, 12 yds → Punt (Pindown +1)
1. 5 plays, 48 yds → Snapkick 35 yds GOOD (5)
1. 4 plays, 22 yds → Snapkick 42 yds GOOD (5)
1. 6 plays, 67 yds → TD (9)
1. 5 plays, 55 yds → TD (9)
1. 3 plays, 8 yds → Punt (Pindown +1)

**BC Bells:** Recovered fumble (+0.5), recovered muffed punt (+0.5), forced fumble on kick return (+0.5), recovered blocked punt (+0.5) = 2 Bells

**Game Flow Notes:**

- BC’s Kicking ZB (Dual-Threat archetype) hit 2/3 snapkicks from 35+ yards
- Providence’s Running ZB scored 2 TDs but fumbled twice
- BC’s Bend Don’t Break defense held Providence to 3 TDs despite 420 total yards
- High Bell count (3.5 total) reflects chaotic, turnover-heavy game

## Penalty System (NEW)

The current simulation has no penalties. This is a significant gap—penalties account for 5–8% of all plays in real football and create critical variance in drive outcomes.

### Why Penalties Matter

- **5–8% of all plays** result in a penalty
- **12–15 penalties per game** (both teams combined)
- **80–120 penalty yards per game** (both teams combined)
- Penalties extend drives (defensive fouls) and kill drives (offensive fouls)
- Discipline becomes a meaningful team attribute

### Penalty Categories

        if play_result.yards > penalty.yards + 5:
            return True  # Big gain beats penalty yards

### Team Discipline Attribute

Add a **Discipline** rating (0–100) to teams:

|Discipline|Penalty Modifier|Description                       |
|----------|----------------|----------------------------------|
|90–100    |0.70×           |Elite discipline, rarely penalized|
|75–89     |0.85×           |Well-coached, few mistakes        |
|60–74     |1.00×           |Average                           |
|45–59     |1.15×           |Undisciplined, frequent flags     |
|<45       |1.30×           |Sloppy, penalty-prone             |

**Discipline modifiers by coach archetype:**

|Coach Archetype|Discipline Modifier|
|---------------|-------------------|
|Traditionalist |+15                |
|Grinder        |+10                |
|Balanced       |+0                 |
|Innovator      |−5                 |
|Gambler        |−10                |

**Discipline degradation:**

- Team stamina below 70%: −10 effective discipline
- 4th quarter, close game: −5 effective discipline
- Rivalry game: −5 effective discipline

## Version History

- **v3.12** (Current): Added complete implementation spec for remaining features — Tier 1 (carrier selection, explosive runs, play signatures, Viper Jet), Tier 2 (Viper alignment, defensive alignment matchups, Keeper matchup, run-specific fumbles, fumble recovery contest), Tier 3 (stat splits, assists, ST), Tier 4 (full playstyle AI). All with code samples and priority order.
- **v3.11**: Added lateral assist system (hockey/basketball style assists for pitchers). Added complete special teams system — position definitions for kickoff, kick return, punt, punt return, and FG units. Added auto-select functions for ST units from existing roster. Added full special teams stats tracking. Updated box score format with all stat categories.
- **v3.10**: Added stat tracking requirements (rushing vs lateral yards, detailed kicking stats). Added kick frequency root cause analysis — punt rate is upstream blocker, fix sequence documented. Specific code issues identified with line numbers.
- **v3.9**: Added comprehensive run game specification — 7 run types (Dive, Power, Sweep, Speed Option, Counter, Draw, Viper Jet) with base yards and variance, positional ball carrier selection, gap/tackle mechanics, defensive matchup matrix, TFL fumble boost, adjusted base yards for lower averages with explosive upside.
- **v3.8**: Implementation priority list with detailed fixes — Bell scoring implementation, Safety detection, kick decision engine overhaul, punt rate reduction with hard rule overrides, fumble system expansion to all ball-carrying plays, drive tracking fix. Full code samples for each.
- **v3.7**: Critical bug fixes — place kick selection override on 6th down in FG range (was 0.01/team, target 1.5-2.5), pindown detection fix after punt resolution (was 0.2/game, target 2-4). Added Bell scoring rule clarification (no self-recovery scoring, one Bell per play max).
- **v3.6**: Added Pindown rule using CFL rouge logic — ball must die in end zone, returner can escape. Added escape probability system and Keeper decision logic.
- **v3.5**: Expanded offensive playstyle system from 5 to 8 styles — Ground & Pound, Lateral Spread, Boot Raid, Ball Control, Ghost Formation, Rouge Hunt, Chain Gang, Triple Threat. Added Green Zone concept, Keeper fatigue, playstyle matchup matrix, and validation targets per style.
- **v3.4**: Added comprehensive offensive philosophy — down mapping (6th = 4th down in football), play selection by situation, snap kick live-ball rules, run vs lateral decision framework, clock management logic
- **v3.3**: Critical punt rate fix — increased aggression modifiers, added possession cost to punt EV, hard rule overrides for egregious punts, go-for-it threshold matrix
- **v3.2**: Expanded penalty system with Too Many Men, Taunting, Unsportsmanlike Conduct, Clipping, Chop Block, Tripping, Lateral Interference, Illegal Contact, Excessive Celebration; added post-play penalty handling and coach discipline modifiers
- **v3.1**: Added penalty system with implementation code, discipline attribute
- **v3.0**: Added fumble system overhaul (fumbles on all ball-carrying plays), EV-based kick decision system with implementation code
- **v2.0**: Added kicking game calibration, archetype profiles, AI playcalling logic, sample outputs
- **v1.0**: Initial scoring targets and drive mechanics
