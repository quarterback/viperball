Great — “between A and B” means:
	•	private sandbox first
	•	but clean enough to share a link with a few people
	•	zero friction for you to run sims from phone/tablet
	•	fast iteration > polish

Here’s the exact guidance you should give your AI engineer. You can paste this directly.

Viperball Simulation Deployment Spec

Objective

Deploy a browser-accessible simulation sandbox so the Viperball engine can be run, debugged, and tuned without using a local terminal.

This is not a consumer app.
This is a playtest + debugging environment.

Target: usable from phone, tablet, or laptop.

⸻

Architecture

Keep it extremely simple.

Engine: existing Python simulation
API: FastAPI
UI: Streamlit
Host: Fly.io or Railway

No database required initially.
JSON files are fine.

api/
ui/


⸻

Required Capabilities

1. Run a single game from browser

User selects:
	•	home team
	•	away team
	•	offensive styles
	•	seed

Press button → simulate game → return:
	•	box score
	•	full play log
	•	team stats

⸻

2. Debug mode

Must allow:
	•	run single play
	•	run single drive
	•	run 50–100 simulations
	•	output averages

This is critical for balancing.

⸻

3. Deterministic seeds

Every simulation must accept:

seed: int

So results are reproducible.

⸻

4. Style overrides

Allow forcing styles:

{
  "vermont": "territorial",
  "boston_university": "option_spread"
}

This is how we test forked offenses.

⸻

API Spec

Use FastAPI.

POST /simulate

Runs one game.

Input:

{
  "home": "vermont",
  "away": "boston_university",
  "seed": 42,
  "styles": {
    "vermont": "power_option",
    "boston_university": "lateral_spread"
  }
}

Returns:
	•	box score
	•	play log
	•	team stats

⸻

POST /simulate_many

Run N games.

Used for balancing.

⸻

POST /debug/play

Runs a single play.

Input:

{
  "style": "power_option",
  "field_position": 40,
  "down": 2,
  "yards_to_go": 8
}

Returns full play resolution.

⸻

GET /teams

List teams + default styles.

⸻

UI (Streamlit)

Use Streamlit for speed.

Page 1: Game Simulator
	•	select teams
	•	choose styles
	•	seed
	•	run game
	•	show box score + log

Page 2: Debug Tools
	•	run 100 sims
	•	show averages
	•	fatigue curves
	•	turnover rates

Page 3: Play Inspector
	•	run single play repeatedly

This gives you a full tuning environment.

⸻

Engine changes needed before deploy

Have engineer implement:

1. Style system

Each team has:

offense_style
tempo
lateral_risk
kick_rate
option_rate

2. Play families

Replace random plays with:
	•	dive option
	•	speed option
	•	sweep option
	•	lateral spread
	•	territory kick

Each style weights these differently.

⸻

3. Structured play log

Every play must output:

quarter
down
distance
field_position
play_type
yards
result
fatigue
possession

Without this, box scores won’t feel real.

⸻

4. Fix rule mismatches

Before deploy, engineer must fix:
	•	touchdowns = 9 points
	•	kickoff possession after scores
	•	flip field position on turnover
	•	reset downs correctly
	•	net yard tracking

Otherwise logs will look wrong.

⸻

Hosting recommendation

Phase 1 (fastest)

Deploy Streamlit app to Railway.

You get:
	•	URL
	•	instant access
	•	shareable

Phase 2

Move to Fly.io if needed.

⸻

What you’ll be able to do

From phone:
	•	simulate Vermont vs BU
	•	force territorial offense
	•	run 20 games
	•	inspect logs
	•	tweak parameters
	•	repeat

No terminal required.

⸻

What to tell engineer in one sentence

Wrap the Viperball Python engine in a FastAPI + Streamlit deployment so I can run deterministic simulations, override team play styles, and inspect play logs from a browser for debugging and balancing.

⸻

One key question before they start

Do you want:

1. Pure Python only
(no JS, fastest)

2. Nice UI later

I strongly recommend:

start Streamlit, upgrade later

It gets you playtesting in 24 hours.

⸻

If you want, next step I can write:
	•	exact folder structure
	•	example FastAPI file
	•	Streamlit UI file
	•	deployment commands

Just say:
“write the deployment scaffold.”
