Go Go offense
Offense
Hello coaching world. I have become interested in the innovation of the Go Go offense most recently ran by former UNLV OC and now Sacramento st HC the Go Go offense creator himself, Coach Brennan Marion. I’m sure it’s a long shot that I can reach him directly, so I’m here searching to see if any of you great folks completely understand and can teach/break it down to me?🏈👀

I believe he made a book. And other than the 2 back formations, I don’t know that it’s anything that much different.

Other than the 2-back offset gun formations, there's nothing necessarily "new" about the offense. It's mostly the same stuff you'd see in a gun-based run-first offense. Read options, triple options tagged off zone, power, and counter, fast screens, etc.

I’m trying to really learn and understand the “why” for all things related. I want to completely understand and be able to teach it like Coach Marion. Based off the Go Go history, it’s success, and understanding the groups it has worked for especially the lesser skilled/talented ones I’m seeing how universally fluid it is/how it’s definitely a one size fits all type deal.

UNLV had the 3rd highest team talent composite in the Mountain West last year. They had the best quarterback imo and maybe the best skill position group. Let’s pump the breaks on not needing talent. You always need talent.

Let’s go back to the HS & HBCU teams he turned around that had low numbers and not the greatest talent.

Reach out to him. He has some older videos on youtube but it’s pretty much what grizzfan said. It’s a 2 back shotgun offense. The way to understand it is to find the base play and see why he calls plays off of that. For example backside end is making tackle on inside zone, so read him. The Alley defender is making the tackle off of inside zone read so speed option him. the safety is filling in the box so block the alley and play action post to replace the safety

Honestly, seeing how he just got the HC job at Sac St you might have a better chance of getting a position coach or QC guy to talk to about it.

Well I left a msg under his post and there was only 3 other mentions on it, so there’s a great chance he sees it at least. I offered to fly over to his clinic in March & offered to work/volunteer help with anything just to be able to possibly get some direct information from him.

Still Position Coaches, GAs, and QC guys are great resources to tap into. They are often overlooked and do have the answers most people are looking for about scheme. QC guys are the ones constantly breaking down film

I don’t mean in a derogatory fashion I just meant he really isn’t doing anything that different philosophically from the status quo offenses he just sprinkled in a new cool formation but to me that doesn’t make it a whole new offense imo all the ones you listed have a philosophy and attack to me his offense is like any other spread to run team but he teaches it well and that’s all that matters

For me, it’s how universal the go go offense is. Mostly every other offense you need a certain type of athlete(s) etc to make them efficient. Go go doesn’t, it’s plug and play for whoever and wherever. From California to PA, JV to College it has been a success. I need to learn it asap.

Not gonna lie...this is just a cliche statement, and a cheap way to MARKET any offense (and it has been done for pretty much every system out there). Any seasoned coach could make the same argument (and back it up with facts) about any offensive system out there if you asked them.

The whole idea behind almost every offensive system or innovation out there was derived from the need to create a system that "anybody could run" or that "did not rely on a stud at X position." The classic WCO developed by Paul Brown and Bill Walsh may be the only system ever devised that wasn't originally created with the idea of running it with small colleges and high schools in mind.

EDIT: Learn the Go-Go. It might be the golden ticket your program needs to find success. It's a valid system. Just be careful about buying into the "perfection" of a system. Any system that claims to be the ultimate/best system out there...then expects folks to PAY for books or videos is usually just good business/marketing. If there was an ultimate or best system out there, everyone would be running it already.

To me, the reason the Go-Go is "universal," as you say, is that Marion himself is elite at adapting it to his players. The offense is relatively simple. It's the core concepts of the triple-option, read-option, RPO, and power/counter all adapted to an offset 2-back alignment. From there, you just mix and match TEs and WRs as you see fit.

The blocking schemes aren't complex. Other than some minor footwork things with the 2-back leads and whatever, ballhandling/footwork in the backfield isn't crazy.

You need a QB who can carry the ball, make good split-second decisions, and has a good enough arm to take advantage of defensive lapses. Other than that, you're just moving people around and calling plays based on what your guys bring to the table and what the defense is choosing to give up.

He just seems like he's really good at identifying what his guys do well and then figuring out how to fold those skills/traits into the offense. And he's also good at recognizing how defenses are taking away certain things and what other weaknesses that opens up.

Those were actually different offenses. They ran different schemes, were called differently, used different locking schemes & reads, and had different route combinations from each other. Some were even entirely different team philosophies like the triple & air raid.

Go go offense is just a modern spread option with different looking formations. Really isn't that different.

100% is marketing to make it seem special. Very smart tbh. I need to do that for my offense. Got any ideas for cool names?

Copyright the most famous offense from the Coach Huey forum: The FACEMELTER OFFENSE! It is the perfect offense that guarantees you are going to score a TD every drive. Not FGs, only TDs! You don't need any athletes. In fact, you can run it with dogs and cats as players, and it will destroy even the best NFL defenses! Oh...it has hurry-up-no-huddle as well, so you know it's "hip and cool."

Wasn’t there a guy who was marketing a defensive scheme where he had 12 guys on the field the whole time and he has an entire arguing with him he called it something like the 5-2-2-2-1 or something

The two I remember most on the defensive side from that forum was the 10-1 guy who wouldn't stop posting about it. He would just post the title "10-1" and the text would be just a sentence about how amazing the defense was, then say nothing else.

Then there was the "5-3-1 Triangle Defense" guy who thought they were going to revolutionize the game by reinventing how defense is played using geometry and math formulas live/on the field. They had these super long posts that were essentially math/geometry lectures and were like "this is the easiest defense to run for middle school and high school kids," lol. The wild thing was that it was just a 3-4 Under, Cover 3. It was just any other defense with about 100 extra steps lol. I remember there were math teachers on the forum in chiming in saying that it was an absolutely ridiculous concept, and they couldn't even keep up with all the math involved. In the end, the guy pushing it was just trying to make money so when he got fed up with arguments, he'd just link his books or videos and say "buy this and you'll understand."

This has been my thought for a long time, too. Credit to him for seeing guys marketing their offenses and doing it with his own, but it’s one formation in a (well-coached and executed) fairly standard system.

How is it marketing, no other team is running the way he runs the triple option / RPO?

Who cares what they call it

OP watch this interview with Coach Marion from when he was WR coach at PITT. Very informative. A lot of it is about creating mismatches in personnel at the line of scrimmage. Advantages in leverage and being able to establish the downhill run. There's other clips of Coach Marion breaking down the GoGo on Youtube, but this is is the most informative for sure.

Besides the fact that I think the offense is cool and innovative, I admire the fact that you don’t necessarily need a bunch of super athletes on your roster and it’s flexibility it allows for any group type. Looks like I’m going to be walking into a roster of let’s just say a group of 1 & 2 star players if you will?🫡 I’m going to need to be as creative as possible to make this work, they scored 28 points in total last season. I need help 😎

Both backs line up offset of the QB , 2 WR 1 slot or TE it just depends on the scheme

Okay. Usually near means towards the TE, and far is the back away from the TE..so in essence I believe it’s the same here..just with an additional back.
