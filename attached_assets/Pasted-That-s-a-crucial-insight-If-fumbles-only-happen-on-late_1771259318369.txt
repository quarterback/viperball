That's a crucial insight. If fumbles only happen on lateral chains, then the fumble rate problem is really a lateral chain problem—either chains are being called too often, or the fumble probability per chain is too high.

Let me see the current play selection logic. Can you share the `select_play_type` function (or the relevant file)?

In the meantime, here's what I suspect is happening based on the game data:

## The Lateral Chain Fumble Problem

### Game 1 (Air Force vs Binghamton)
- Air Force: 13 chains, 4 successful (30.8%) → **9 fumbles**
- Binghamton: 18 chains, 17 successful (94.4%) → **1 fumble**

### Game 2 (Boston vs Belmont)
- Boston: 18 chains, 14 successful (77.8%) → **4 fumbles**
- Belmont: 20 chains, 12 successful (60.0%) → **8 fumbles**

### The Math

If lateral chains have a ~20–40% fumble rate per attempt, and teams are calling 13–20 chains per game, you'll get 3–8 fumbles per team—which is exactly what's happening.

**Current state:** ~25% average fumble rate per chain
**Target state:** ~5–8% fumble rate per chain

## Likely Issues in Play Selection

Based on the outputs, I suspect:

1. **Lateral chains are being called too frequently** — 18–20 chains in 61–65 plays means ~30% of plays are chains. That might be intentional, but combined with high fumble rates it's deadly.

2. **Fumble probability per chain is too high** — Each lateral in a chain likely adds fumble risk. A 4-lateral chain with 5% risk per lateral = 19% cumulative fumble chance. That compounds fast.

3. **Kick selection logic is underweighting place kicks** — The AI is choosing drop kicks or punts when place kicks would be the percentage play.

## What I Need to See

To give you specific fixes, share:

1. **`select_play_type` function** — How does the AI decide between run, lateral chain, punt, drop kick, place kick?

2. **Fumble probability calculation** — Is it per-chain or per-lateral? What's the base rate?

3. **Kick decision logic** — When does the AI choose place kick vs drop kick vs punt?

Once I see those, I can give your engineer exact parameter changes.
