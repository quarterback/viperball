Implementation logic your engineer should use:

Step 1 — Generate full odd round robin
Add a ghost team to make N+1 even.
Run the circle method for N rounds.
That produces N rounds, each team plays N−1 games and has 1 bye.

Step 2 — You now have too many games
Full round robin gives each team N−1 opponents.
You only want 8.

So you need to drop (N−1 − 8) opponents per team.

For each size:

9 teams → N−1 = 8 → perfect. Use full round robin. Done.
11 teams → N−1 = 10 → drop 2 opponents per team.
13 teams → N−1 = 12 → drop 4 opponents per team.
15 teams → N−1 = 14 → drop 6 opponents per team.

Important: You must remove opponents symmetrically. That means removing entire rounds (perfect matchings), not individual games.

Why? Because each round is a disjoint pairing set. Removing one full round subtracts exactly one opponent from every team and preserves structural balance.

Therefore:

11 teams
Generate 11 rounds.
Keep 8 rounds.
Drop 3 full rounds.

13 teams
Generate 13 rounds.
Keep 8 rounds.
Drop 5 rounds.

15 teams
Generate 15 rounds.
Keep 8 rounds.
Drop 7 rounds.

9 teams
Generate 9 rounds.
Keep all 9 rounds.

This guarantees:

– 8 unique opponents
– 1 bye per team
– Balanced participation
– No duplicates

Home/away balancing:

When generating the full schedule, alternate home polarity in the circle algorithm.
Before dropping rounds, calculate home counts per team.
When choosing which rounds to drop, run a simple optimization pass:

Minimize variance of:
– total home games
– protected rivalry removals
– travel distance (if relevant)

A simple integer linear program can choose which rounds to keep under those constraints. For 15 teams you’re only choosing 8 of 15 rounds, which is computationally trivial.

Summary per league size:

9 teams → full round robin, 9 weeks, 8 games + 1 bye.
11 teams → 9-week season, drop 3 rounds from full RR.
13 teams → 9-week season, drop 5 rounds.
15 teams → 9-week season, drop 7 rounds.

One unified algorithm works for all four cases.

If you want, I can also outline how to layer divisional protection or rivalry locks on top of this without breaking symmetry.
