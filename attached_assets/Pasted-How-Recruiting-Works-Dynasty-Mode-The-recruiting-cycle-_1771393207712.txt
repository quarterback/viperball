How Recruiting Works (Dynasty Mode)
The recruiting cycle runs during the offseason via Dynasty.run_offseason(). Here's the flow:

1. Recruit Pool Generation — A national class of 300 high-school prospects is generated each year. Each recruit has:

A star rating (1-5★) visible to everyone — distribution is roughly 3% five-star, 12% four-star, 35% three-star, 35% two-star, 15% one-star
Hidden true attributes (speed, agility, kicking, etc.) that are only revealed through scouting
A position, hometown, high school, and personality preferences
2. Scouting — You spend scouting points (30 per cycle) to reveal hidden info:

Basic scout (1 point): reveals their top 3 attributes (with ±3 noise) and a fuzzy potential range like "High (4-5★)"
Full scout (3 points): reveals all 11 attributes, exact potential, development trait, and true overall
3. Offers — You can extend up to 15 scholarship offers from 8 open roster spots. CPU teams auto-target recruits matching their prestige tier and region.

4. Recruit Decisions — Each recruit weighs three factors based on their randomized personality:

Prestige (20-60% weight) — your team's historical win%, championships, recent record
Geography (10-40% weight) — bonus if you're in their home region
NIL money (remainder) — how much you're offering vs. the market
Top-star recruits decide first. This means elite programs with high prestige and big NIL budgets land the 5-stars, while lower-prestige programs compete for 3-star gems.

How the Transfer Portal Works
Let me show you the decision logic:


Examined transfer portal scoring logic in engine code

Why players enter the portal (_should_enter_portal in transfer_portal.py:313):

Graduates: 60% chance to enter as a grad transfer
Seniors: only 5% (they're about to graduate anyway)
Everyone else: ~8% base rate, increased by losing record (+10% if team wins < 40%), and increased for high-potential players stuck on bad teams. Low-potential players are less likely to transfer (nowhere better to go)
Where they go — Same weighted formula as recruits: prestige × their prestige preference + geography × their geo preference + NIL × their NIL preference + random noise. Best players pick first.
