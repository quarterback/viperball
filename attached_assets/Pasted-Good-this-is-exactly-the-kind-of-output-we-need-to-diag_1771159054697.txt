Good — this is exactly the kind of output we need to diagnose the engine.

Here’s the straight read:

What these sims are telling us

Scores are extremely low
	•	4.4 vs 5.2 average
	•	That’s basically all field goals / safeties
	•	TD generation is too rare

Yards are reasonable
	•	~200 per game per team
So movement exists.
But drives aren’t converting to scoring.

Too many ties
	•	12 ties out of 50 = 24%
That’s way too high unless intentional.

Win distribution is fine
	•	16 / 22 split looks normal
So balance isn’t broken.

⸻

Core problem

The engine currently behaves like:

territorial rugby with no finishing phase

Drives move
then stall
then kick
then repeat

So you’re getting:
	•	realistic field position movement
	•	unrealistic scoring conversion

This is a red zone + breakaway probability issue.

⸻

What needs tuning (priority order)

1. Explosive play generation

Right now:
	•	long runs probably too rare
	•	lateral chains not producing breakthroughs
	•	Viper not creating chaos

We need:

10–15% of drives produce a scoring break

Not:

2–3%

Fix

Increase:
	•	breakaway multiplier once past midfield
	•	lateral success compounding effect
	•	defensive fatigue impact late drive

⸻

2. Red zone conversion model

You likely don’t have a separate model for:

inside 20
inside 10
goal line

Without that, drives stall forever.

Add:

Inside 20:
	•	tighter defense
	•	higher turnover risk
	•	higher TD probability

Inside 10:
	•	power run bonus
	•	fumble spike
	•	TD spike

⸻

3. Kicking equilibrium

If teams are kicking too often:
scores stay low.

Check:

kick_decision_weight

Especially for Zeroback archetypes.

You want:
	•	kicks for field position
	•	not kicks every drive

⸻

4. Fatigue impact too weak

Fatigue curves are probably not affecting defense enough.

Late drives should produce:
	•	missed tackles
	•	broken contain
	•	longer runs

If fatigue isn’t opening the game up:
everything stays compressed.

⸻

5. Turnovers may be too low

Ironically:
you want slightly more turnovers.

Why?

Turnovers create:
	•	short fields
	•	sudden scores
	•	volatility

Right now it’s probably:

long drives → stall → kick

Instead:

drive → fumble → short field → score


⸻

Target statistical profile

For a healthy Viperball sim:

Average score

9–18 points per team

Yards

180–260

TD rate

1–2 per team

Drop-kicks

1–3 per game

Ties

<10%


⸻

Engine adjustments to tell your engineer

Give them this:

Increase explosive threshold

When a run exceeds 12 yards:

chance_breakaway += speed_gap * fatigue_gap

Lateral phase multiplier

Each successful lateral:

explosive_chance += 5%
turnover_chance += 3%

Red zone boost

Inside 20:

td_chance += 30%
turnover_chance += 10%

Inside 10:

td_chance += 50%

Fatigue scaling

After 8-play drive:

defense_tackle -= 10
defense_speed -= 8


⸻

What I want to see next

Run:

200 simulations

and send:
	•	avg score
	•	TD per game
	•	fumbles per game
	•	kick frequency
	•	longest play

We are trying to reach the point where logs look like:

12-play drive
lateral chain
break run
TD

instead of:

9-play drive
punt

⸻

Big picture

You are VERY close.

Movement numbers look correct.
Structure is working.

Now we just need:
finishing + chaos tuning.

Once scoring opens up, the game will suddenly feel real.
