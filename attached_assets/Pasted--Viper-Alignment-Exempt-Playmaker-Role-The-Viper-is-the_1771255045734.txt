### Viper (Alignment-Exempt Playmaker)

**Role:** The Viper is the offensive wild card—the only player exempt from formation rules, wearing a distinctly colored jersey. They can line up anywhere pre-snap: in the backfield, on the line, split wide, or in motion. The best Vipers are unguardable because defenses can't predict where they'll be or what they'll do.

**Archetypes:**

| Type | Primary Threat | Secondary Threat | Playstyle |
|------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Receiving Viper** | Chain target in space | Screen plays | Lines up wide or in motion, catches laterals at full speed. Creates mismatches against linebackers and slower defenders. |
| **Power Viper** | Short-yardage conversions | Lead blocking | Lines up in backfield, takes direct handoffs. Battering ram on 5th/6th down. Can also clear lanes for ZB/flankers. |
| **Decoy Viper** | Drawing coverage | Occasional explosive touch | Pre-snap movement pulls defenders out of position. Doesn't need the ball to impact the play—creates space for others. |
| **Hybrid Viper** | Unpredictable usage | Everything | Can do it all at a B+ level. Defensive coordinators lose sleep. |

**Statistical Targets by Archetype:**

| Metric | Receiving Viper | Power Viper | Decoy Viper | Hybrid Viper |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Touches/game | 10–14 | 8–12 | 4–7 | 8–11 |
| Yards/touch | 8–12 | 4–6 | 10–15 | 7–10 |
| Rush yards/game | 15–30 | 40–65 | 10–20 | 25–45 |
| Lateral receptions/game | 6–10 | 2–4 | 2–4 | 4–7 |
| TDs/game | 0.8–1.5 | 0.6–1.2 | 0.3–0.7 | 0.6–1.0 |
| Decoy snaps (no touch) | 15–25% | 10–15% | 50–65% | 25–40% |
| "Viper impact" plays* | 4–6 | 3–5 | 5–8 | 4–6 |

*Viper impact play: any play where pre-snap Viper alignment causes a defensive adjustment or breakdown*

**Attribute Weights by Archetype:**

| Attribute | Receiving Viper | Power Viper | Decoy Viper | Hybrid Viper |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Speed | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Power | ★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★ | ★★★ |
| Hands | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Agility | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Football IQ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ |
| Stamina | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ |

**Defensive Adjustments by Archetype:**

| Facing... | Defensive Response | Creates Opportunity For... |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Receiving Viper | Shadow with fastest defender, bracket in red zone | Inside runs, ZB scrambles |
| Power Viper | Stack box when Viper aligns in backfield | Perimeter chains, flanker speed |
| Decoy Viper | Ignore motion, stay disciplined | Viper actually getting the ball |
| Hybrid Viper | Assign spy, react post-snap | Slower defensive reactions everywhere |

**Playcalling Implications:**

- **Receiving Viper teams** should call chain plays targeting the Viper on 2nd/3rd down, use motion to create favorable matchups
- **Power Viper teams** should use the Viper as a closer—short-yardage and goal-line packages
- **Decoy Viper teams** should move the Viper pre-snap on 70%+ of plays, actual touches are misdirection
- **Hybrid Viper teams** should vary Viper usage by game flow—decoy early, receiving mid-game, power in red zone

**Recruiting Pipeline Indicators:**

Track sprinters and rugby sevens wings trend toward Receiving Vipers. Rugby forwards and soccer strikers trend toward Power Vipers. Basketball point guards and netball centers trend toward Decoy Vipers (high IQ, spatial awareness). AFLW utility players trend toward Hybrid Vipers.

### Flankers (Halfback, Left Wingback, Right Wingback, Shiftback)

**Role:** The flankers are the workhorses—they touch the ball most often, grind out yards, and score the plurality of TDs. Each position has subtle differences, but they share a common profile: reliable, versatile, durable.

**Position-Specific Roles:**

| Position | Alignment | Primary Role | Secondary Role |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Halfback** | Directly behind ZB | Inside runs, chain safety valve | Pass protection equivalent (screens, delays) |
| **Left Wingback** | Wide left, off the line | Perimeter chains, sweeps | Reverse plays, kick returns |
| **Right Wingback** | Wide right, off the line | Perimeter chains, sweeps | Reverse plays, kick returns |
| **Shiftback** | Motion/flex position | Pre-snap motion, misdirection | Fills gaps in formation |

**Archetypes (apply to any flanker position):**

| Type | Primary Trait | Usage Pattern |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Speed Flanker** | Breakaway threat | Gets ball in space, perimeter plays |
| **Power Flanker** | Yards after contact | Inside runs, chain extensions |
| **Elusive Flanker** | Missed tackle generator | Open field touches, screen plays |
| **Reliable Flanker** | Low fumble rate, consistent | High-volume touches, clock control |

**Statistical Targets (Per Flanker):**

| Metric | Speed | Power | Elusive | Reliable |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| Touches/game | 5–8 | 6–10 | 5–8 | 8–12 |
| Yards/touch | 6–9 | 4–6 | 7–10 | 4–6 |
| TDs/game | 0.4–0.8 | 0.3–0.6 | 0.4–0.7 | 0.3–0.5 |

| Total touches | 22–32 |
| Total yards | 120–180 |
| Total TDs | 1.5–2.5 |
| % of team offensive touches | 55–65% |

**Attribute Weights by Archetype:**

### Offensive Line (5 Linemen)

**Role:** The line creates running lanes, sets screens for chain plays, and protects the ZB during kick setups. Unlike traditional football, Viperball linemen are more athletic—they need to move laterally and set screens downfield.

**Archetypes:**

| Type | Primary Strength | Team Fit |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Maulers** | Drive blocking, create push | Ground & Pound, Power running |
| **Screens** | Second-level blocks, lateral movement | Lateral Spread, Chain-heavy |
| **Hybrids** | Balanced, adaptable | Any scheme, flexibility |

**Line Unit Ratings:**

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|--------------|
| Run block grade | 70–90 |
| Screen block grade | 70–90 |
| Kick protection grade | 65–85 |
| Blown assignments/game | 1–3 |

### Defensive Positions

#### Line Anchors (Left Guard, Nose, Right Guard)

**Role:** The front three occupy blockers, control gaps, and disrupt plays at the point of attack. They're the first line of defense against inside runs.

| Missed tackles/game | 0.5–1 | 0.2–0.5 | 0.8–1.5 |

#### Lastback (Deep Safety)

**Archetypes:**

| Type | Primary Trait | Role |
|------|--------------|------|
| **Return Keeper** | Speed, open-field running | Turns missed FGs into scoring opportunities |

### Defensive Scheme Profiles

| Scheme | Front Alignment | Spotback Role | Corner Role | Best Against | Vulnerable To |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Contain** | Hold gaps, don't penetrate | Fill, read, react | Force inside | Lateral Spread, misdirection | Power running, patient offense |
