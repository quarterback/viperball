That's a crucial rule clarification that changes everything about kick decision-making:

---

## Snap Kick Rule: Missed Kicks Stay Live

**Current assumption:** Snap kick miss = turnover (like a missed FG in football)
**Actual rule:** Snap kick miss = live ball, your team can recover and retain possession

This makes snap kicks **way less risky** than the sim thinks. The EV calculation is wrong.

---

## Revised EV Calculation for Snap Kicks

**Old (incorrect):**
```python
ev_snap_kick = success_rate * 5  # Miss = lost possession
# 50% accuracy from 40 yards = 2.5 EV
```

**New (correct):**
```python
# If you miss, you might recover and keep the ball
recovery_rate = 0.35  # Team recovers own missed snap kick ~35% of time

ev_snap_kick = (success_rate * 5) + ((1 - success_rate) * recovery_rate * continuation_value)

# 50% accuracy from 40 yards:
# = (0.50 * 5) + (0.50 * 0.35 * 2.5 field position value)
# = 2.5 + 0.44
# = 2.94 EV (not 2.5)
```

And if the recovery spot is decent (say, opponent's 35 after a missed 45-yarder), you still have the ball in FG range.

## Snap Kick vs Place Kick Decision Matrix

| Situation | Place Kick | Snap Kick | Winner |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Miss = turnover | 3 pts × 85% = 2.55 EV | 5 pts × 60% = 3.0 EV | Snap Kick |
| Miss = live ball (35% recovery) | N/A (always turnover) | 5 × 0.60 + (0.40 × 0.35 × 2.5) = 3.35 EV | Snap Kick by more |
| Trailing by 2 | 3 pts ties | 5 pts wins | Snap Kick |
| Trailing by 4 | 3 pts still losing | 5 pts wins | Snap Kick |

**Snap kicks should be attempted way more often because:**
1. 5 points > 3 points
2. Miss isn't automatic turnover
3. Creates chaos/Bell opportunities

## 5th Down vs 6th Down Logic Fix

You're right—the current logic wastes a down:

**Current (wrong):**
- 5th down: Punt or kick
- 6th down: Almost never reached

**Correct:**
- 5th down: Go for it (you still have 6th down!)
- 6th down: Punt, place kick, or snap kick

```python
def select_kick_decision(self):
    # NEVER punt or place kick on 5th down unless desperate
    # You still have 6th down!
    
    if down == 5:
        # Only kick options on 5th: snap kick (low risk) or go for it
        if fg_distance <= 50 and kicker_skill >= 65:
            # Snap kick is worth considering — miss isn't fatal
            consider_snap_kick = True
        
        # NEVER place kick on 5th — you're giving up a down for no reason
        consider_place_kick = False
        
        # NEVER punt on 5th unless pinned inside own 15
        if field_position >= 15:
            consider_punt = False
    
    if down == 6:
        # NOW you make the "end of possession" decisions
        consider_place_kick = True
        consider_punt = True
        consider_snap_kick = True
        
        # Still go for it if short yardage
        if yards_to_go <= 4:
            favor_go_for_it = True
```

## Updated Decision Flow

**1st–4th down:** Run offense, go for it on 4th if short or in opponent territory

**5th down:**
- **Go for it** (default) — you have one more down
- **Snap kick** if in range (40–55 yards) — miss isn't fatal, might score 5
- **Punt only** if pinned inside own 15

**6th down:**
- **Place kick** if in range (inside 45) — take the 3 points
- **Snap kick** if longer range or trailing — go for 5
- **Go for it** if 4th-and-short or in red zone
- **Punt** if in own territory and out of FG range

## Recovery Mechanics for Missed Snap Kicks

Need to define what happens on a miss:

```python
def resolve_missed_snap_kick(self, kick_distance, kicker_position):
    # Ball is live after missed snap kick
    
    # Determine where ball lands
    if kick_missed_wide:
        landing_spot = kicker_position + random.uniform(kick_distance * 0.7, kick_distance * 0.9)
    elif kick_missed_short:
        landing_spot = kicker_position + random.uniform(kick_distance * 0.4, kick_distance * 0.7)
    
    # Determine who recovers
    kicking_team_recovery_chance = 0.35  # Base rate
    
    # Modifiers
    if ball_lands_near_sideline:
        kicking_team_recovery_chance += 0.10  # Easier to down
    if defense_was_rushing:
        kicking_team_recovery_chance += 0.05  # Defense out of position
    
    if random.random() < kicking_team_recovery_chance:
        # Kicking team recovers — Bell! (+0.5) and keeps possession
        return Recovery(team="offense", spot=landing_spot, bell=True)
    else:
        # Defense recovers — Bell! (+0.5) and gets possession
        return Recovery(team="defense", spot=landing_spot, bell=True)
```

## Expected Impact

| Metric | Current | After Fix | Target |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Snap kick attempts/game | 0.8–1.2 | 2.5–4.0 | 2–4 |
| Snap kick makes/game | 0.5–0.7 | 1.2–2.0 | 1–3 |
| 5th down punts | Common | Rare | Rare |
| 6th down situations | 0% | 15–25% of drives | 15–25% |
| Bells from missed kicks | ~0 | 0.5–1.0 | 0.5–1.5 |

This is a significant gameplay change—snap kicks become a real weapon instead of a curiosity, and the 6-down system actually gets used.
