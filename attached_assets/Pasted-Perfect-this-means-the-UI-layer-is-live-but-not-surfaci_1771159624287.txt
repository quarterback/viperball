Perfect — this means the UI layer is live but not surfacing meaning yet.

Right now your sandbox is producing:
	•	box score
	•	play family breakdown
	•	play-by-play
	•	JSON

but the screen you pasted shows empty rendering, which tells me:

the engine is generating data
but the UI isn’t mapping it into readable structures

So this is not a tuning problem anymore.
It’s a presentation + debugging visibility problem.

Good place to be.

What we need now

You don’t need new mechanics.
You need to see the sport clearly.

Tell your engineer to implement these 4 views.

⸻

1. REAL BOX SCORE (non-negotiable)

The current output should render like this:

CREIGHTON 24
GONZAGA 21

TD
FG (drop)
FG (place)
Safeties

Yards
Rush yards
Kick yards
Turnovers
Longest play
Drives

Right now you’re likely just dumping JSON.

Have the API return:

{
  "box_score": {...},
  "team_stats": {...},
  "drive_summary": [...],
  "play_log": [...]
}

And force UI to render those explicitly.

If box score is blank, the problem is:

field names mismatch

Not engine logic.

⸻

2. PLAY FAMILY DISTRIBUTION

This is where identity shows up.

You want a chart like:

Option: 42%
Sweep: 18%
Lateral chain: 12%
Territory kick: 14%
Trick: 6%

If every team shows the same distribution,
your archetypes aren’t distinct enough.

If distributions vary by team:
you’ve succeeded.

⸻

3. DRIVE OUTCOME PANEL

Add this immediately.

For each drive:

Start yard line
Plays
Yards gained
Result:
  TD
  Drop kick
  Punt
  Fumble
  Downs

This tells you if the game feels real.

You want drives like:

6 plays → TD
9 plays → drop kick
3 plays → fumble

Not:

9 plays → punt
8 plays → punt
10 plays → punt


⸻

4. PLAY LOG WITH ROLE TAGS

Right now your logs likely say:

Run for 6 yards
Lateral
Run for 3

Instead show:

ZB keep → 6
HB pitch → 4
SB lateral → Viper → 22
Tackle by SP1

You want to see positions acting.

Otherwise everything feels anonymous.

⸻

5. CRITICAL DEBUG PANEL

Add a hidden debug toggle showing:

fatigue curves
explosive trigger %
turnover triggers
kick decision %

This lets you tune without guessing.

⸻

What I want you to do next

Run one sim and paste:

1. full box score

2. drive summary

3. 10 plays of log

Not screenshots of empty UI —
actual JSON or text.

Then I can confirm:
	•	are roles visible
	•	do drives feel real
	•	does the sport have identity

⸻

Big picture

You are no longer building mechanics.

You are now in the phase where:

the sport exists
now we make it legible

Once the logs read like a real game,
Viperball will suddenly feel like something people can watch.
