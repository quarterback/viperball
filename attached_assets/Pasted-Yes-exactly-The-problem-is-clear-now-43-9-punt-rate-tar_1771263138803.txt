Yes, exactly. The problem is clear now:

- **43.9% punt rate** (target: 25–35%)
- **0% turnover on downs** — teams NEVER go for it on 6th down
- Red zone conversion is great (74.9%) — finishing isn't the problem
- Getting to the red zone is the problem

The AI is way too conservative. With 6 downs to get 20 yards, teams should be sustaining drives and going for it more often, not punting on 5th down from midfield.

## Root Cause

The EV calculation is still overvaluing punts and undervaluing going for it. Teams are punting from positions where they should be attempting to convert.

**Key question:** Where are these punts happening? If teams are punting from the opponent's 40–50, that's an EV bug. If they're punting from their own 20–30, that might be appropriate.

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix 1: Make Go-For-It EV More Aggressive

The current aggression modifiers aren't aggressive enough:

```python
# Current
aggression = {4: 1.15, 5: 1.0, 6: 0.85}

# Proposed — much more aggressive
aggression = {4: 1.35, 5: 1.20, 6: 1.05}
```

Even on 6th down, going for it should be slightly favored over punting in most situations. You have 6 downs for a reason.

### Fix 2: Reduce Punt EV Significantly

The punt EV calculation is probably too generous. Punting gives up possession—that's costly.

```python
# Current punt EV (guessing at structure)
ev_punt = (3.0 - opponent_fp_value) + (pindown_prob * 1)

# Proposed — add possession cost penalty
possession_value = 2.0  # Giving up the ball costs ~2 points of EV
ev_punt = (3.0 - opponent_fp_value) + (pindown_prob * 1) - possession_value
```

This makes punting a last resort rather than a default.

### Fix 3: Boost Continuation Value for Go-For-It

When calculating go-for-it EV, the continuation value (what happens if you convert) should be higher:

```python
# Current (guessing)
continuation_value = self.field_position_value(new_fp_if_convert)

# Proposed — factor in full drive potential, not just next play
continuation_value = self.field_position_value(new_fp_if_convert) * 1.3
# Plus add expected scoring from sustained drive
continuation_value += self.expected_drive_points(new_fp_if_convert)
```

### Fix 4: Never Punt Before 5th Down (Hard Rule)

Add a hard floor:

```python
def select_kick_decision(self):
    # Hard rule: NEVER punt before 5th down unless pinned inside own 10
    if down <= 4 and fp >= 10:
        if best_option == 'punt':
            best_option = 'go_for_it'
    
    # On 5th down, only punt if in own territory
    if down == 5 and fp >= 45:  # Past midfield
        if best_option == 'punt':
            # Reconsider — should probably kick FG or go for it
            if fg_distance <= 55:
                best_option = 'place_kick' if ev_place_kick > ev_go_for_it else 'go_for_it'
            else:
                best_option = 'go_for_it'
```

### Fix 5: Add "Go For It" Threshold by Field Position

| Field Position | 4th Down | 5th Down | 6th Down |
|----------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Own 1–20 | Punt | Punt | Punt (unless desperate) |
| Own 21–40 | Punt | Go for it if < 8 yds | Go for it if < 12 yds |
| Own 41–50 | Go for it if < 6 yds | Go for it if < 10 yds | Go for it |
| Opp 49–40 | Go for it if < 8 yds | Go for it / FG | FG or go for it |
| Opp 39–25 | Go for it if < 5 yds | FG | FG |
| Opp 24–1 | Go for it | Go for it / FG | FG or TD attempt |

### Fix 6: Yards Per Play Boost (Supporting Fix)

If drives are stalling because they're not gaining enough yards to stay on schedule:

```python
# Boost average yards slightly
yards_per_play_modifier = 1.12  # +12% yards

# Or reduce negative play frequency
negative_play_chance *= 0.75  # 25% fewer TFLs/losses
```

## Expected Impact

| Metric | Current | After Fix | Target |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Punt rate | 43.9% | 28–35% | 25–35% ✓ |
| Scoring drive % | 26% | 40–50% | 40–55% |
| Turnover on downs | 0% | 3–6% | 3–6% |
| TDs/game | 4.3 | 6–8 | 6–10 |
| Points/team | 27.6 | 38–48 | 40–60 |

## Priority Order

1. **Fix 1 + Fix 2** — Adjust EV calculation (aggression up, punt EV down)
2. **Fix 4** — Hard rule against early punts
3. **Fix 6** — Yards per play boost if still stalling
