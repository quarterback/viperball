Love this pivot.

Here’s a compact **Bowl Name Engine** you can actually use when you’re generating matchups.

---

### 1. Basic structure

Most names follow one of these patterns:

1. **[Sponsor/Concept] + Bowl**  
2. **[Place/Region] + Bowl**  
3. **[Descriptor] + [Object] + Bowl**  
4. **[Person/Legacy] + Bowl**

You can mix and match.

### 4. Make it feel “college”

To make it feel like FBS‑adjacent:

- Use **Classic / Crown / Showcase / Championship** for higher tiers  
- Use **Challenge / Cup / Series** for mid‑tier  
- Use **Invitational / Shield** for quirky or new bowls

If you tell me:

- how many tiers you want (New Year’s Six analog, mid, low),  
I can spit out a full, tiered bowl lineup that matches your fictional conferences.
