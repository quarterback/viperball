Looking at these screenshots, the UI is functional but has some clear areas for improvement. Here's a spec for your engineer:

---

# Viperball Simulator UI Improvement Spec

## Current State Assessment

**What's working:**
- Clean layout, readable typography
- Dropdown selectors function properly
- Red accent color provides visual hierarchy
- Conference setup in Dynasty Mode is intuitive

**What needs improvement:**
- Team Style Configuration (Season Simulator) is tedious—requires manual selection for every team
- No visual distinction between human-controlled and AI-controlled teams
- No team identity information (colors, logos, conference)
- Scheme descriptions are minimal ("No strong tendency, adapts to situation")
- No preview of what schemes mean strategically

---

## Priority 1: AI Team Management (Biggest Pain Point)

The Season Simulator screenshot shows the core problem—you have to manually set offense/defense for every team. This should be automated for non-human teams.

### Proposed Changes

**Add "Human Teams" selector at top of Season Setup:**
```
Human-Controlled Teams (select 1-4)
[ ] American University
[ ] Belmont University
[✓] Boston University    ← User's team
[ ] Bradley University
...
```

**For human-controlled teams:** Show full offense/defense dropdowns (current behavior)

**For AI-controlled teams:** Replace dropdowns with read-only "AI Coach" badge:
```
American University
Offense: AI Coach (Ground & Pound)    [i]
Defense: AI Coach (Pressure)          [i]
```

The `[i]` icon shows a tooltip explaining the AI-assigned scheme based on team profile.

**Add "Randomize AI Schemes" button:**
- Assigns schemes based on team archetypes (from team profile data)
- Adds variance so not every AI team is identical
- User can override individual teams if desired

**Add "Auto-Assign All" toggle:**
- When ON: Only show human team configuration
- When OFF: Show all teams (current behavior for power users)

---

## Priority 2: Team Identity Display

Teams currently show as plain text. Add visual identity.

### Team Card Component

Replace plain dropdown with team cards:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ■ Boston University                 │
│   Terriers | Patriot League         │
│   Colors: Scarlet & White           │
│                                     │
│   Offense: [Lateral Spread    ▼]    │
│   Defense: [Pressure          ▼]    │
│                                     │
│   [Human-Controlled ✓]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Elements:**
- Color swatch (■) showing primary team color
- School name (bold)
- Mascot | Conference (smaller text)
- Offense/Defense selectors
- Human-controlled toggle (instead of separate section)

### Game Simulator Team Display

Same card treatment for the single-game simulator:

```
Home Team                          Away Team
┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ ■ Air Force          │    vs    │ ■ Albany             │
│   Falcons            │          │   Great Danes        │
│   Mountain West*     │          │   America East       │
└──────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────┘

* Note: Air Force is a military academy—consider whether 
  they should be in this league thematically
```

---

## Priority 3: Scheme Selector Improvements

Current scheme descriptions are vague. Make them actionable.

### Expanded Scheme Tooltips

**Offense Options (with descriptions):**

| Scheme | Short Description | Tooltip Detail |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Balanced | Adapts to situation | No strong tendency. Mixes run, chain, and kick based on game state. |
| Ground & Pound | TD-focused rushing | Heavy inside runs, power backs. Low kick attempts, high TD rate. |
| Lateral Spread | Chain-heavy attack | Spreads defense with lateral chains. High-variance, explosive. |
| Kick Heavy | Field goal emphasis | Prioritizes snapkicks and place kicks. Plays for field position. |
| Ball Control | Clock management | Long drives, reliable gains. Wears down defense. |

**Defense Options:**

| Scheme | Short Description | Tooltip Detail |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Base Defense | Solid fundamentals | Balanced approach. No major weaknesses or strengths. |
| Contain | Gap discipline | Prevents big plays, forces runs inside. Vulnerable to patient offense. |
| Pressure | Aggressive disruption | Penetrating front, blitzing spotbacks. High risk/reward. |
| Bend Don't Break | Prevent big plays | Soft coverage, rally to ball. Gives up yards, not TDs. |
| Blitz | Maximum aggression | All-out rush. Devastating or exploited—no middle ground. |

### Visual Scheme Indicator

Add a small radar chart or icon set showing scheme tendencies:

```
Ground & Pound
[TD ████████░░] [Kick ██░░░░░░░░] [Risk ████░░░░░░]
```

Or simpler icon approach:
```
Ground & Pound  🏃💪  (Run-heavy, Power)
Kick Heavy      🦵🎯  (Kicking, Precision)
Lateral Spread  ↔️⚡  (Width, Explosive)
```

## Priority 4: Dynasty Mode Enhancements

### Conference Assignment UX

The "Assign Teams to Conferences" accordion is good, but could show more info:

```
Conference 1: CVL East (6 teams)
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Drag to reorder / move between conferences]   │
│                                                │
│ ■ Boston University (Your Team)                │
│ ■ American University                          │
│ ■ Fairfield University                         │
│ ■ Duquesne University                          │
│ ■ College of Charleston                        │
│ ■ Davidson College                             │
│                                                │
│ Geographic center: Mid-Atlantic                │
│ Avg distance between schools: 312 mi           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Add:**
- Drag-and-drop team assignment
- Geographic coherence indicator
- "Auto-assign by geography" button
- Conference rename inline (not separate field)

### Coach/Dynasty Identity

```
Create New Dynasty
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dynasty Name: [My Viperball Dynasty         ]  │
│ Coach Name:   [Coach                        ]  │
│ Starting Year: [2026]                          │
│                                                │
│ Your Team:                                     │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ ■ United States Air Force Academy        │   │
│ │   Falcons | Independent                  │   │
│ │                                          │   │
│ │   Coaching Style:                        │   │
│ │   [Aggressive ▼] (affects AI perception) │   │
│ │                                          │   │
│ │   Starting Archetype:                    │   │
│ │   [Balanced ▼]                           │   │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Add:**
- Coaching style selector (affects how AI teams prepare for you)
- Starting archetype (sets initial offense/defense philosophy)
- Optional: Coach avatar or initials icon

---

## Priority 5: Visual Polish

### Color System

Current red (`#E53935` or similar) is good for CTAs. Add:

- **Team colors:** Pull from team data, use as accents
- **Scheme colors:** Consistent color per scheme type
  - Ground & Pound: Brown/Bronze
  - Lateral Spread: Blue
  - Kick Heavy: Green
  - Ball Control: Gray
  - Balanced: Purple
- **Conference colors:** Each conference gets a subtle background tint

### Typography Hierarchy

Current hierarchy is decent. Tighten up:

- **H1:** Page titles (Viperball Game Simulator) — keep as-is
- **H2:** Section headers (Home Team, Away Team) — keep as-is
- **H3:** Subsection (Team Style Configuration) — slightly smaller
- **Labels:** Form labels — lighter weight, smaller
- **Descriptions:** Scheme descriptions — italic, muted color

### Spacing

- Add more vertical breathing room between team cards
- Group related controls (Offense + Defense for same team should be visually connected)
- Consistent padding inside cards

---

## Priority 6: Responsive Considerations

The current layout appears desktop-focused. For tablet/mobile:

- Stack Home/Away teams vertically on narrow screens
- Collapse team cards to show only name + scheme summary (expand on tap)
- Season Simulator team grid should wrap to 2 columns, then 1 column

---

## Implementation Order

1. **AI Team Management** — Biggest UX win, reduces setup friction dramatically
2. **Scheme Tooltips** — Quick win, improves understanding
3. **Team Cards with Identity** — Medium effort, high visual impact
4. **Dynasty Mode Enhancements** — Important for long-term engagement
5. **Visual Polish** — Can be iterative

---

## Streamlit-Specific Notes

Streamlit has limitations. Some suggestions for working within them:

**For team cards:** Use `st.container()` with custom CSS via `st.markdown()` with `unsafe_allow_html=True`

**For drag-and-drop:** Consider `streamlit-sortables` or similar community component

**For tooltips:** Use `st.help()` or `st.popover()` (Streamlit 1.29+)

**For color swatches:** Inline HTML/CSS or small colored `st.container()` backgrounds

**For radar charts:** `st.pyplot()` with matplotlib or `st.altair_chart()`

If Streamlit becomes too limiting, consider migrating to Gradio (more flexible layout) or a full React frontend with FastAPI backend.
