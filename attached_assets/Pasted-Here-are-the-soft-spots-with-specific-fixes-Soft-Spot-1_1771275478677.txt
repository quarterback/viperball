Here are the soft spots with specific fixes:

---

## Soft Spot 1: Snap Kicks Too Rare

**Current:** 0.5–0.7 per game
**Target:** 1–3 per game

Snap kicks (drop kicks) are supposed to be a signature Viperball mechanic—the 5-point live-ball field goal that elite Kicking ZBs build their offense around. Right now they barely happen.

**Diagnosis:** The EV calculation probably favors place kicks (safer) or going for TD (more points) in almost all situations. Drop kicks only make sense when:
- Distance favors DK range (40–55 yards) where place kicks are iffy
- Team is trailing and needs 5 instead of 3
- Kicking ZB archetype is on field

**Fixes:**

```python
# 1. Boost DK consideration for Kicking ZB archetype
if zeroback.archetype == "Kicking ZB":
    dk_ev_multiplier = 1.25  # 25% EV boost for specialists
    dk_range_extension = 5   # Attempt from 5 yards further out

# 2. Trigger DK in trailing situations (5 > 3 matters)
if team_trailing and score_diff <= 8:
    dk_ev_multiplier *= 1.15

# 3. Allow DK attempts on earlier downs when in range
if down >= 3 and fg_distance >= 38 and fg_distance <= 52:
    consider_drop_kick = True  # Currently maybe only 5th-6th down?

# 4. Add "shot play" DK attempts — low probability surprise attempts
if random.random() < 0.03 and fg_distance <= 48:  # 3% chance
    attempt_snap_kick = True
```

**Validation target:** After fix, should see 1.5–2.5 snap kick attempts per game, 0.8–1.5 makes.

## Soft Spot 2: Fumbles Still Low

**Current:** 2.3–2.5 per game
**Target:** 4–6 per game

Fumbles create chaos, Bells (0.5 pts), and momentum swings. The game is too clean right now.

**Diagnosis:** Lateral efficiency at 93–95% means chains almost never fail. Run fumbles were cut to 0.8–1.4% base which might be too low.

**Current fumble sources:**
- Lateral chains: ~5–8% cumulative per chain (working, but chains are 94% efficient)
- Runs: 0.8–1.4% base (too low)
- Returns: unclear if implemented

**Fixes:**

```python
# 1. Bump run fumble rates back up slightly
run_fumble_rates = {
    'dive_option': 0.012,    # Was 0.008, bump to 1.2%
    'sweep_option': 0.018,   # Was 0.012, bump to 1.8%  
    'speed_option': 0.020,   # Was 0.014, bump to 2.0%
}

# 2. Reduce lateral efficiency target to 88-91%
# Increase per-exchange fumble rate
lateral_fumble_per_exchange = 0.028  # Was ~0.022, bump to 2.8%

# 3. Add fumble boost on big hits / TFLs
if yards_gained <= 0:  # Stuffed at line
    fumble_prob += 0.025  # +2.5% on TFLs

# 4. Weather impact (already implemented, verify it's aggressive enough)
if weather in ['rain', 'snow', 'sleet']:
    fumble_prob *= 1.35  # 35% increase in bad weather
```

**Validation target:** 4–5 fumbles per game, lateral efficiency 88–92%.

## Soft Spot 3: Pindowns Too Rare

**Current:** 0.5–1.0 per game
**Target:** 2–4 per game

Pindowns (1 pt for forcing opponent to start inside their 10) should reward good punting and special teams. They're barely happening.

**Diagnosis:** Either punts aren't landing inside the 10, or the pindown logic isn't triggering correctly.

**Fixes:**

```python
# 1. Check punt landing distribution
# Target: 25-30% of punts should land inside the 20, 10-15% inside the 10

# 2. Improve punter targeting when in range
if punter_field_position >= 35 and punter_field_position <= 55:
    # "Coffin corner" range — aim for inside 10
    target_landing = random.uniform(3, 12)  # Aim for 3-12 yard line
    punt_variance = 8  # yards of variance
    
# 3. Verify pindown triggers correctly
if opponent_starting_position <= 10:
    award_pindown = True  # 1 point
    
# 4. Add touchback prevention logic
# Punters should try to avoid touchbacks (which give opponent the 20)
if projected_landing <= 5:
    reduce_punt_power()  # Don't boom it into end zone
```

**Validation target:** 2–3 pindowns per game, 25% of punts inside the 20.

## Soft Spot 4: Lateral Efficiency Too High

**Current:** 93–95%
**Target:** 85–92%

Chains are too safe. They should be the high-risk/high-reward option compared to runs.

**Diagnosis:** Per-exchange fumble rate is too low, or chain length distribution skews short (2-lateral chains are safest).

**Fixes:**

```python
# 1. Increase base fumble rate per lateral exchange
fumble_per_exchange = 0.030  # 3% per exchange (was ~2.2%)

# 2. Cumulative probability targets:
#    2-lateral chain: 1 - (0.97)^2 = 5.9% fumble chance
#    3-lateral chain: 1 - (0.97)^3 = 8.7% fumble chance  
#    4-lateral chain: 1 - (0.97)^4 = 11.5% fumble chance
#    5-lateral chain: 1 - (0.97)^5 = 14.1% fumble chance

# 3. Encourage longer chains (more exciting but riskier)
if offensive_style == "lateral_spread":
    avg_chain_length = 3.5  # vs 2.8 for other styles
    
# 4. Defensive pressure should disrupt chains more
if defense_style in ["pressure", "blitz"]:
    fumble_per_exchange += 0.008  # +0.8% per exchange vs aggressive D
```

**Validation target:** Lateral efficiency 88–91%, with visible risk/reward tradeoff vs runs.

## Soft Spot 5: 6th Down Conversion Never Happens

**Current:** 0%
**Target:** Doesn't matter much, but > 0% shows teams use all 6 downs

Teams never face 6th down because they punt or kick before then. This is mostly fine—the 6-down system means you rarely exhaust all chances—but seeing occasional 6th down attempts would show the system working.

**Diagnosis:** AI kicks/punts on 5th down almost always. 6th down only happens if 5th down attempt fails.

**Fixes:**

```python
# 1. Slightly increase go-for-it rate on 5th down in opponent territory
if down == 5 and field_position >= 50:
    go_for_it_threshold += 0.10  # More aggressive

# 2. Log when 6th down situations occur
# Even if rare, they should happen sometimes

# 3. Make sure 6th-and-short triggers go-for-it
if down == 6 and yards_to_go <= 5:
    always_go_for_it = True  # No punting on 6th-and-short
```

**Validation target:** 0.5–2% of drives reach 6th down, with some conversions.

---

## Priority Order

1. **Snap kicks** — Signature mechanic that's missing
2. **Fumbles / lateral efficiency** — Needs more chaos
3. **Pindowns** — Rewards special teams play
4. **6th down** — Minor, mostly cosmetic
