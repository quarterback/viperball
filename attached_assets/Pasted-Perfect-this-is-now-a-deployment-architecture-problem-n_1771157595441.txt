Perfect — this is now a deployment architecture problem, not a rules problem.

You want:

run simulations
debug engine
playtest styles
generate logs
without needing a desktop terminal

So your AI engineer needs a lightweight deployable sim environment you can hit from phone/tablet/browser.

Below is exactly what to tell them.
No fluff. This is the build spec.

⸻

🧠 Goal

Deploy the Viperball simulation engine so you can:
	•	run games from browser
	•	tweak parameters
	•	test play styles
	•	generate box scores + logs
	•	debug engine
	•	not rely on local terminal

This is NOT a production app.
This is a simulation sandbox.

⸻

🏗 Recommended Architecture (simple + fast)

Python sim engine stays as-is.
We wrap it in a tiny API and web UI.

Frontend: simple web UI (or even static HTML)
Backend: FastAPI
Engine: existing Python game_engine
Hosting: Fly.io or Railway
Storage: JSON files

You can build this in 1–2 days.

⸻

🧩 Component breakdown

1. Engine layer (already exists)

Your repo:

/engine/game_engine.py

Leave it pure Python.

But expose one entry point:

simulate_game(home_team, away_team, seed=None, style_overrides=None)

Return:

{
  box_score,
  play_log,
  drive_summary,
  stats
}

This must be deterministic with seed.

⸻

2. API wrapper (critical)

Have your engineer build:

api/main.py

Using FastAPI.

Endpoints:

POST /simulate

Run a game.

Body:

{
  "home": "vermont",
  "away": "boston_university",
  "seed": 123,
  "styles": {
     "vermont": "power_option",
     "boston_university": "lateral_spread"
  }
}

Returns:

box score
play log
team stats

POST /season

Simulate week or season.

GET /teams

List available teams + styles.

POST /debug/run_play

Run single play for tuning.

This endpoint will be gold for balancing.

⸻

3. Frontend (minimal)

Do NOT overbuild.

Just give yourself a control panel.

Page 1: Game Sim
	•	select teams
	•	choose styles
	•	seed
	•	run game
	•	see box score + log

Page 2: Debug
	•	run single drive
	•	run 100 games
	•	see averages

Use:
	•	plain HTML
	•	or React if engineer insists
	•	or Streamlit (fastest)

If you want fastest:

use Streamlit

Then you literally deploy the UI with the engine in one app.

⸻

🚀 Deployment options

Option A — fastest: Fly.io

Good for:
	•	Python
	•	always-on
	•	cheap

Engineer does:

fly launch

Deploy FastAPI app.

You get:

viperball.fly.dev

You hit it from phone.

⸻

Option B — Railway

Even easier.

Push repo → deploy → done.

⸻

Option C — Replit (quickest debug)

If this is mostly playtesting:

Put engine + UI in Replit.
You get instant browser access.

⸻

🧪 Debug tooling you need

Tell your engineer:

Must have seed control

So you can reproduce games.

Must have style overrides

You want to force:

vermont = territorial
bu = option_spread

Must log:
	•	play type
	•	yards
	•	fatigue
	•	possession
	•	branch decisions

Readable logs > pretty UI.

⸻

⚙️ Engine changes required before deploy

Have them implement:

1. Style system

Each team JSON:

{
  "offense_style": "power_option",
  "tempo": 0.7,
  "kick_aggression": 0.3,
  "lateral_risk": 0.4
}

2. Deterministic RNG

random.seed(seed)

so you can replay games.

3. Play log structure

Every play should output:

{
  quarter,
  down,
  distance,
  field_pos,
  play_type,
  yards,
  result,
  fatigue
}

This is what makes box scores believable.

⸻

📊 What you’ll be able to do after deploy

From your phone:
	•	simulate Vermont vs BU
	•	switch to territorial offense
	•	run 50 games
	•	see averages
	•	tune lateral risk
	•	fix bugs
	•	watch play logs
	•	iterate rules

No terminal needed.

⸻

🧠 Tell your engineer this exactly

You can literally paste this to them:

Build a lightweight FastAPI wrapper around the Viperball engine so I can run simulations from a browser.

Requirements:
	•	deterministic seed support
	•	team style overrides
	•	simulate single game endpoint
	•	simulate season endpoint
	•	debug endpoint for single play
	•	deploy on Fly.io or Railway
	•	simple web UI (Streamlit acceptable)

Goal: I want to run games and debug engine logic from my phone without using a terminal.

⸻

🔥 My recommendation

Use Streamlit first.

It gives you:
	•	UI
	•	deploy
	•	logs
	•	sliders
	•	buttons

in one file.

Your engineer could ship this in a day.

Then later:
	•	move to proper web UI if needed.

Question for you

How serious is this deployment?

A — quick sandbox for you
B — shareable public sim
C — full league sim site

Answer with A/B/C.
