✅ COMPLETE! Viperball is now AFL-style gridiron
🎮 Test Results (Gonzaga vs Villanova, Seed 42)

Broken-play scores
🎯 The Sport You Designed:
Gridiron Aussie Rules + Rugby Sevens + 7-man Football

✅ Gridiron structure (downs, field position)
🚀 Next Steps?
Your web UI is ready. The engine is tuned. What do you want to build next?

Player background traits (soccer/rugby specialists)
Recruiting system (300-500 recruits per class)

Dynasty progression (player development)
Something else?
The AFL-style engine is live! 🏈

adding a new rule meaning the engine needs to be updated with this 

Pindown (1 point)
A pindown is awarded to the kicking team when any live kick results in the receiving team being downed, tackled, or forced to concede the ball in their own end zone.
A pindown may be scored on:

punts
territory kicks
drop‑kicks
place‑kicks (missed or blocked)
No Pindown Is Awarded If:
the receiving team returns the ball out of the end zone
the receiving team laterals the ball out of the end zone
the receiving team kicks the ball back into the field of play
the ball goes out of bounds in the end zone without possession

Perfect! Pindown (1 point) is the missing AFL piece! This adds so much strategic depth to kicking.

Let me implement it now:


Updated todo list
it's the CFL single point/rouge



Ah! CFL Rouge/Single Point! Even better - that's the perfect kicking rule. Let me implement it:


Updated game_engine.py with new PlayResult enum values

Now let me add pindown logic to punts:


Fixed punt return logic in game engine
Show more

Now add pindown to missed drop-kicks:


Updated turnover logic in game_engine.py

Now add pindown to missed place-kicks:


Updated turnover logic and field position calculations in game_engine.py

Now let me add pindown tracking to stats:


Updated game engine statistics calculation logic

Now let me test the CFL rouge/pindown system:

🎉 PERFECT! CFL Rouge/Pindown is LIVE!

Game 1: Gonzaga 10 - Villanova 27 → 8 PINDOWNS
Game 2: Gonzaga 27 - Villanova 21 → 5 PINDOWNS  
Game 3: Gonzaga 23 - Villanova 15 → 9 PINDOWNS
Game 4: Gonzaga 5 - Villanova 20 → 6 PINDOWNS
Game 5: Gonzaga 14 - Villanova 35 → 3 PINDOWNS

Sample plays:

VB17 punt → 53 yards — PINDOWN! +1
VB7 drop kick 47yd — NO GOOD → PINDOWN! +1
The CFL rouge works perfectly! Teams are getting 3-9 pindowns per game. Let me commit this:


Added Pindown scoring rule and implemented pindown logic for punts

✅ CFL ROUGE/PINDOWN COMPLETE!
🏈 What Got Added:
Pindown (1 Point) - CFL Rouge Rule
Awarded when:

Punt lands in end zone → receiving team downed there
Missed drop-kick → lands in end zone, can't be returned out
Missed place-kick → lands in end zone, can't be returned out
NOT awarded when:

Receiving team returns it out
Receiving team laterals it out
Receiving team kicks it back into play
Ball goes out of bounds (touchback)
📊 Test Results (5 Games)
Game 1: Gonzaga 10 - Villanova 27 → 8 pindowns
Game 2: Gonzaga 27 - Villanova 21 → 5 pindowns  
Game 3: Gonzaga 23 - Villanova 15 → 9 pindowns
Game 4: Gonzaga 5  - Villanova 20 → 6 pindowns
Game 5: Gonzaga 14 - Villanova 35 → 3 pindowns

Average: 6.2 pindowns per game ✅

🎮 How It Works:
Punt Example:

VB17 punt → 53 yards — PINDOWN! +1

Punt goes 53 yards into end zone
Receiving team tries to return (based on speed)
Can't get out → PINDOWN!
Kicking team scores 1 point
Then kicks off to receiving team
Missed FG Example:

VB7 drop kick 47yd — NO GOOD → PINDOWN! +1

Drop kick misses from 47 yards
Ball lands in end zone
Receiving team can't return out → PINDOWN!
🏆 Strategic Impact:
Deep punting now scores - Even if you don't pin them deep, you can score!
Missed FGs aren't wasted - Miss from 40+ yard line? Might still get 1 point
Territorial kicking rewarded - Makes kick-heavy teams even more viable
Return game matters - Fast teams can escape, slow teams get pinned
🚀 Viperball Now Has:
✅ AFL-style kicking frequency (53% of plays)
✅ Rugby-style lateral risk (69% efficiency)
✅ Chaos mechanics (tips, bounces, returns)
✅ CFL rouge/single point (3-9 per game)

This is truly unique! No other sport has this exact combination.
