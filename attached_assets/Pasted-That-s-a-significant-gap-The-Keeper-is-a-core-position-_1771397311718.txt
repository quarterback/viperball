That's a significant gap. The Keeper is a core position in Viperball — the last line of defense, the Keeper matchup on explosive runs, the zone keeper chess match with the ZB.

Let me check what the spec says about positions and what the engineer needs to add:

---

## Positions per Spec

| Position | Code | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| **Zeroback** | ZB | Offensive hub — runs, pitches, kicks |
| **Viper** | VP | Wildcard — exempt from formation rules |
| **Flankers** | HB, WB, SB | Ball carriers, blockers, lateral targets |
| **Keeper** | KP | Deepest defender — last line, fields kicks, breakaway matchups |

**Flanker Archetypes:** Speed, Power, Elusive, Reliable, Hybrid

**Keeper Role (from earlier sessions):**
- Fields missed kicks and punts
- Last line on explosive runs (Keeper matchup system)
- Zone Keeping vs Boot Raid offense
- Stats: tackles, ST tackles, forced fumbles, kick deflections

---

## What's Likely Missing in the Engine

1. **KP position code** — Does the roster have Keepers?
2. **Keeper attributes** — Speed, Tackling, Awareness for matchup resolution
3. **Keeper in explosive run resolution** — The `resolve_keeper_matchup()` function references `self.defense.get_keeper()` — does that method exist?
4. **Keeper fatigue tracking** — Boot Raid wears down the Keeper
5. **Keeper stats** — `st_tackles`, `forced_fumbles`, `kick_deflections`
6. **Keeper on special teams** — Punt return safety, kick fielding

---

## Need to Verify

Can you check with the engineer or in the codebase:

1. Is `KP` in the position tags?
2. Does `team.get_keeper()` or `defense.get_keeper()` return a player?
3. Is there a Keeper archetype?
4. Are Keeper stats being tracked?

If Keeper isn't implemented, that's a gap in the gameplay — the explosive run system and Boot Raid counter won't work correctly without the Keeper matchup.

Want me to write a Keeper implementation spec for the engineer? It would cover:
- Position definition
- Attributes
- Matchup mechanics (already in the spec but may not be wired up)
- Stats tracking
- Special teams role
