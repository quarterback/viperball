The place kick rate is the broken thing. 0.01 per team means it's basically never happening—that's a bug, not a tuning issue.

## Priority Fixes

### 1. Place Kicks (BROKEN)

**Current:** 0.01/team
**Target:** 1.5–2.5/team

Something is preventing place kicks from being selected. Check:

```python
# Is place kick even in the options?
# Is the FG distance calculation correct?
# Is the EV being calculated?
# Is there a hard rule blocking it?

# On 6th down in FG range, place kick should be the DEFAULT
if down == 6 and fg_distance <= 50:
    if not going_for_td_on_short_yardage:
        return 'place_kick'  # This should fire often
```

The 6th down logic we discussed earlier might not be implemented—teams might still be punting or going for it when they should be taking the 3 points.

### 2. Pindowns (Too Low)

**Current:** 0.2/game
**Target:** 2–4/game

Pindowns come from punts landing inside the 10. With 20% punt rate, there should be ~6 punts per game. If 30% land inside the 10, that's ~2 pindowns. Currently getting 0.2, so either:

- Punts aren't landing deep enough
- Pindown detection isn't triggering
- Touchbacks are killing pindown opportunities

```python
# Check punt landing distribution
if punt_lands_inside_10 and not_touchback:
    award_pindown = True  # Is this firing?
```

### 3. Punt Rate (Slightly Low)

**Current:** 20.3%
**Target:** 25–35%

This is actually close. If place kicks start working, some drives that currently end in "go for it" failures might end in punts instead (from worse field position after turnovers). Might self-correct.

### 4. Snap Kicks (Slightly Low)

**Current:** 0.40/team
**Target:** 0.5–1.5/team

Close. Once place kicks are fixed, the snap kick vs place kick decision will have real tension. Might need a small boost to snap kick attempts in trailing situations.

## Diagnosis Order

1. **Why are place kicks at 0.01?** — This is the priority. Log the 6th down decisions and see what's being chosen instead.

2. **Where are punts landing?** — Distribution check. Are they hitting the end zone (touchback) or the 10–20 (no pindown)?

3. **Snap kick triggers** — Are trailing teams attempting them?

What does the engineer see when logging 6th down decisions?
