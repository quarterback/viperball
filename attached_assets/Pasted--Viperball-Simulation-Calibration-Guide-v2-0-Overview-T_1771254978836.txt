# Viperball Simulation Calibration Guide v2.0

## Overview

This document provides calibration targets for the Viperball simulation engine. The goal is to produce a dynamic, watchable sport with touchdowns as the primary scoring method, a robust kicking game as a legitimate alternative offensive philosophy, and chaos events (Bells, Pindowns) adding texture.

**Core Design Principles:**
- 6 downs to gain 20 yards (3.33 yards/play to stay on schedule)
- No forward pass—lateral chains replace passing offense
- Kicking is live offense, not just field position management
- TDs are natural and frequent, not rare events
- Kicking-heavy teams are a viable archetype, not a gimmick
- 85–90% defensive success rate creates meaningful defense with explosive exceptions

## Scoring System

| Event | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Touchdown | 9 | Ball carried or kicked into end zone |
| Snapkick (Drop Kick FG) | 5 | Live-ball drop kick through uprights from anywhere |
| Place Kick FG | 3 | Traditional place kick from scrimmage |
| Safety | 2 | Offense downed in own end zone or commits foul there |
| Pindown | 1 | Force opponent to start drive inside own 10-yard line |
| Bell | 0.5 | Recover any loose ball (fumble, muff, blocked kick) |

---

## Scoring Distribution Targets

### League-Wide Averages (Per Team Per Game)

| Scoring Event | Target Range | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Touchdowns | 3–5 | Primary scoring method |
| Snapkicks (made) | 0.5–1.5 | Playmaker-dependent, high variance |
| Place Kick FGs (made) | 1.5–2.5 | Reliable points, developed kicking culture |
| Safeties | 0.1–0.3 | Rare, high-leverage |
| Pindowns | 1–3 | Organic from punting/kicking game |
| Bells | 2–4 | Fumbles, muffs, blocked kicks |
| **Total Points** | **40–60** | Higher-scoring than current sim |

### Team Archetype Scoring Profiles

| Archetype | TDs | Snapkicks | Place Kicks | Style |
|-----------|-----|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **TD-Heavy** | 5–6 | 0–0.5 | 0.5–1 | Pound the ball, score in end zone |
| **Balanced** | 3–4 | 0.5–1 | 1.5–2 | Multiple threats, adaptable |
| **Kick-Heavy** | 2–3 | 1.5–2.5 | 2.5–3.5 | Death by field goals, prevent defense |
| **Chaos** | 3–4 | 0.5–1 | 1–2 | High turnovers forced, Bells galore |

### Game Totals (Both Teams Combined)

| Metric | Target Range |
|--------|--------------|
| Total TDs | 6–10 |
| Total Snapkicks (made) | 1–3 |
| Total Place Kicks (made) | 3–5 |
| Total Points | 80–120 |
| Games with 100+ points | 20–30% |
| Games under 60 points | 10–15% |

## Kicking Game Calibration

### Place Kick Field Goals

Place kicks are the reliable, high-percentage option. With larger goalposts and targeted recruiting of Australian, Gaelic, and soccer players, place kicking becomes a developed skill in Viperball.

**Success Rates by Distance:**

| Distance | Success Rate | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| <25 yards | 90–95% | Near-automatic |
| 25–34 yards | 82–90% | Highly reliable |
| 35–44 yards | 70–82% | Standard range |
| 45–54 yards | 55–70% | Long but makeable |
| 55+ yards | 35–50% | Specialist territory |

**Attempt Frequency (Per Team Per Game):**

| Team Archetype | Attempts | Makes | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|-------|
| TD-Heavy | 1–2 | 0.5–1.5 | Only when TD unlikely |
| Balanced | 2–3 | 1.5–2.5 | Situational |
| Kick-Heavy | 4–6 | 3–4.5 | Primary scoring method |

**AI Playcalling Triggers for Place Kicks:**

- 4th–6th down inside opponent's 40: Consider place kick
- 5th–6th down inside opponent's 30: Strong place kick lean
- Trailing by 1–3 points, final 2 minutes: Place kick if in range
- Leading by 7+, any field position: Place kick over risky TD attempt

### Snapkicks (Drop Kick Field Goals)

Snapkicks are the high-risk, high-reward option. They can be attempted from anywhere during live play, but require elite skill. The best Kicking ZBs turn snapkicks into a primary weapon.

**Success Rates by Distance:**

| Distance | Elite Kicker | Good Kicker | Average Kicker |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| <25 yards | 80–88% | 70–78% | 60–70% |
| 25–34 yards | 68–78% | 55–65% | 45–55% |
| 35–44 yards | 52–65% | 40–50% | 30–40% |
| 45–54 yards | 35–48% | 25–35% | 15–25% |
| 55+ yards | 18–30% | 10–18% | 5–12% |

**Attempt Frequency by Team Archetype:**

| Team Archetype | Attempts/Game | Makes/Game | Conversion % |
|----------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| TD-Heavy | 0–1 | 0–0.5 | 50–60% |
| Balanced | 1–2 | 0.5–1 | 55–65% |
| Kick-Heavy | 3–5 | 1.5–2.5 | 55–70% |
| Elite Kicking ZB | 4–6 | 2–3.5 | 60–75% |

**AI Playcalling Triggers for Snapkicks:**

- Kicking ZB teams: Attempt from 45+ yards on 3rd–4th down
- Any team: Consider snapkick on 4th down past midfield if Kicking ZB
- Trailing late: Snapkick attempts increase (5 pts vs 3 pts matters)
- Kick-Heavy archetype: Attempt snapkick before place kick when in range for both

### Punting

Punting remains a field position tool, but should be less frequent than current sim.

**Punt Statistics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Punts per team per game | 3–5 |
| Average punt distance | 38–45 yards |
| Punts inside 10-yard line | 25–35% |
| Punts resulting in Pindown | 20–30% |
| Blocked punts per game (both teams) | 0.1–0.3 |
| Muffed punt returns per game | 0.2–0.4 |

**AI Playcalling Triggers for Punts:**

- 5th–6th down in own territory: Punt unless desperate
- 5th down between own 40 and opponent's 45: Situational (game state)
- 6th down anywhere past own 35: Go for it or kick FG, rarely punt
- Pinned inside own 10: Punt on 4th+ down

|-----------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Standard run (contained) | 65–75% of runs | 3–4 yds | 2–5% |
| Gap breakdown run | 12–18% of runs | 10–18 yds | 12–18% |
| Missed tackle run | 10–15% of runs | 15–30 yds | 22–35% |

| Chain + gap breakdown | 8–12% of chains | 12–22 yds | 15–25% |

### Defensive Scheme Effectiveness Matrix

| Offense \ Defense | Contain | Pressure | Bend Don't Break | Blitz |
|-------------------|---------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Ground & Pound | Neutral | +8–12% O | −5–8% O | High variance |

## AI Playcalling Logic

### Expected Value Recalculation

**Current problem:** AI punts too early because expected value of continuing is calculated too low.

**Fix inputs:**
- TD value: 9 points (weight heavily)
- Snapkick value: 5 points (factor in attempt probability and success rate)
- Place kick value: 3 points (high success rate from close range)
- Pindown value: 1 point (factor into punt EV)
- Bell probability: Factor in fumble risk on continued drives

### Playcalling Decision Tree

**1st–3rd down:**
- Almost never punt unless pinned inside own 5
- Run offense based on scheme and personnel

**4th down:**
- Own 0–30: Punt (unless desperate)
- Own 30–45: Situational (game state, score, time)
- Own 45–Opp 45: Go for it (6 downs is forgiving)
- Opp 45–35: Consider snapkick if Kicking ZB
- Opp 35–25: Place kick or snapkick consideration
- Opp 25–0: Go for TD, place kick if stalled

**5th down:**
- Own 0–35: Punt
- Own 35–Opp 40: Go for it
- Opp 40–30: Snapkick range (Kicking ZB) or go for it
- Opp 30–0: Place kick or go for TD

**6th down:**
- Own 0–25: Punt (desperation only)
- Own 25–Opp 45: Go for it
- Opp 45–35: Place kick (long) or go for it
- Opp 35–0: Place kick

### Archetype-Specific Adjustments

**Kick-Heavy Teams:**
- Attempt snapkicks starting at opponent's 45
- Prefer place kicks to TD attempts when inside 30
- Punt earlier to play field position game
- Run prevent-style defense when leading

**TD-Heavy Teams:**
- Go for it on 5th/6th down more aggressively
- Rarely attempt snapkicks
- Place kicks only when TD is unlikely
- Aggressive defense to force turnovers

**Balanced Teams:**
- Standard decision tree
- Adapt to game state

### Game State Modifiers

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| Trailing by 10+ | +25% go-for-it rate, +20% snapkick attempts |
| Leading by 10+ | +20% punt/FG rate, conservative |
| Final 5 min, trailing | Almost never punt, aggressive kicks |
| Final 5 min, leading | Run clock, take points when available |
| Final 2 min, trailing by 3–8 | Snapkicks become premium (5 > 3) |
