## 1. Fundamentals

### Origin

Viperball began as a thought experiment inspired by a Reddit discussion about whether a late-19th-century team could compete in modern football.

Original thread: [What if the entire 1894 Yale team came back to life?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1r4qgd3/what_if_the_entire_1894_yale_team_came_back_to/)

The discussion raised a key question: if early teams played under rules closer to their own era—no forward pass, heavier kicking, fewer specialized roles—what would a modern version of that game look like? Viperball is the answer to that question, creating a modern tactical sport that honors the historical roots of football while developing its own strategic depth.

### Design Philosophy

Viperball assumes a timeline where:

- The forward pass never became dominant
- Kicking remained central to strategy
- Players continued to play both ways
- Football evolved around space, stamina, and field position.

### Players

- 11 players per side

#### Substitution Rules

**Substitution Type:**
- Unlimited substitutions are permitted
- Substitutions may only occur during dead-ball stoppages (after the play is ruled dead and before the next snap)
- On-the-fly substitutions during live play are prohibited

**Active Roster:**
- Teams maintain a 36-player active game-day roster
- All active players are eligible to play

**Substitution Procedure:**
- A player exiting the field must fully leave the playing surface before their replacement enters
- Substituting players must enter and exit from the team's designated sideline area
- Failure to follow proper procedure results in an **Illegal Substitution** penalty (5 yards, enforced at snap)

**Injury Substitutions:**
- A player removed from the game due to injury may not return for a minimum of one play
- If the injury occurs during the final two minutes of a half, the injured player's team is charged a timeout (see §14 Clock Management for full injury timeout protocol)
- Players removed under concussion protocol may not return to the same game (see §25 Player Safety)

### Equipment

- Pads optional depending on league level
- Helmets recommended for competitive play

#### Ball Specifications

**The official game ball is a Canadian football (CFL-spec).**

- **Circumference:** 12⅞ to 13⅛ inches (short axis); 27¾ to 28¼ inches (long axis)
- **Weight:** 14 to 15 ounces
- **Material:** Leather or approved composite
- **Inflation:** 12.5 to 13.5 psi

**Rationale:** The Canadian football's slightly rounder shape compared to an American football supports drop-kick accuracy and bounce predictability, which are central to Viperball strategy.

**Ball Provision:**
- Each team must provide a set of game balls
- Officials inspect and approve all balls before the game
- Balls found to be improperly inflated or damaged during play will be replaced

---

## 2. Game Structure

### Game Length

- 4 quarters
- 12–15 minutes each
- Running clock except final 2 minutes of each half

League organizers may adjust timing.

---

## 3. Downs & Possession

- 5 downs to gain 20 yards
- Gaining 20 yards resets the count
- Failure after 5 downs results in turnover at the spot

---

## 4. Movement of the Ball

Teams may advance the ball by:

- Running
- Laterals and backward passes
- Kicking (punt or drop kick)

### Forward Pass

Forward passes are not permitted.

Any forward throw results in:

- Dead ball
- Loss of down
- Penalty yardage (league-defined)

---

## 5. Kicking

Kicking may occur at any time during live play.

Players may:

- Punt forward
- Drop kick
- Attempt field goals
- Kick ahead and pursue

The ball remains live after a kick unless it passes through the uprights for a scoring play or goes out of bounds.

### Drop-Kick Requirements

A drop kick is defined as a kick where the ball visibly contacts the ground before being kicked. A kick that does not touch the ground is a punt, not a drop kick.

### Blocked and Deflected Kicks

**Blocked Kick:**
- A blocked kick remains live and may be recovered by either team
- A blocked field goal attempt that does not cross the line of scrimmage may only be recovered by the kicking team
- The ball is live from the spot where it was blocked

**Tipped/Deflected Kick:**
- A kick deflected or tipped by a player remains live
- A drop kick that is tipped or deflected but still passes through the uprights counts as a successful field goal (5 points)

### Illegal Kick

An **illegal kick** is a kick that violates the rules of play. The following constitute illegal kicks:

1. **Kick by a downed player:** A kick made by a player who is down (on the ground) with any part of their body other than hands or feet touching
2. **Kick after change of possession:** A kick made after a change of possession on the same play (e.g., a defensive player kicks after recovering a fumble before establishing possession and advancing — the ball must be possessed and controlled first)
3. **Second kick behind the line:** A second kick by the same team on the same play behind the line of scrimmage (only one kick from behind the line of scrimmage is permitted per play; open-field kicks beyond the line of scrimmage are unrestricted)
4. **Place kick during open play:** A place kick attempted during live open-field play (place kicks must originate from scrimmage, not during live play advancement)
5. **Kick to avoid safety:** A kick made in the end zone by the offense to avoid a safety

**Penalty for illegal kick:** 5 yards from the spot of the kick (see §23 Penalties)

### Ball Spotting After Kicks

**Partially Blocked Kick:**
- Spotted at the point where the ball is recovered or goes dead

**Kick Traveling Backward:**
- Spotted at the point where the ball is recovered
- If untouched and out of bounds, spotted at the out-of-bounds point

**Kick Hitting a Player Unintentionally:**
- Ball remains live; no re-spot
- If the ball subsequently goes out of bounds, spotted at the exit point

---

## 6. Scoring

### Touchdown — 9 points

Scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. No conversion attempts are taken.

### Drop-Kick Field Goal — 5 points

A successful drop kick through the uprights. May be attempted from scrimmage or during live play.

### Place-Kick Field Goal — 3 points

A successful place kick through the uprights. Must be taken from scrimmage.

### Safety — 2 points

Awarded to the defense when the offensive team is downed in its own end zone.

### Pindown - 1 point 

A pindown is awarded to the kicking team when any live kick results in the receiving team being downed, tackled, or forced to concede the ball in their own end zone.

A pindown may be scored on:
- punts
- territory kicks
- drop‑kicks
- place‑kicks (missed or blocked)

**No Pindown Is Awarded If:**
- the receiving team returns the ball out of the end zone
- the receiving team laterals the ball out of the end zone
- the receiving team kicks the ball back into the field of play


### Fumble Recovery — 0.5 points
Awarded to the defense when it gains possession of a loose ball during live play, including:

- forced fumbles

- mishandled laterals

- dropped or bouncing kicks

- any loose ball recovered by the defense before the play is whistled dead

The ball remains live and may be advanced.
- If the recovery results in the ball being carried into the end zone, standard touchdown or pindown rules apply.

---

## 7. Restarts

### After Touchdown

Scoring team kicks off from midfield or its own 35 (league preference).

### After Field Goal

Opposing team receives kickoff.

### After Safety

Free kick from scoring team's 20.

---

## 8. Kickoff Rules

### Intent

Kickoffs restart play and create field position battles. The kicking team attempts to limit return yardage while the receiving team seeks optimal field position.

### Alignment

**Kicking Team:**
- Must have at least 4 players on each side of the kicker
- All players except the kicker must be behind the ball at kickoff
- Players may not cross the restraining line until the ball is kicked

**Receiving Team:**
- Must have at least 7 players within 15 yards of their restraining line
- May not cross the restraining line until the ball is kicked
- Must have designated return personnel positioned in the return zone

### Live Ball

The ball is live once kicked and may be:
- Advanced by the receiving team
- Recovered by the kicking team if it travels at least 20 yards
- Downed by the receiving team for a touchback

### Onside Kicks

Onside kicks are permitted. The kicking team may recover the ball once it has traveled at least 20 yards. The receiving team may recover the ball at any point after it is kicked.

### Fair Catch

Fair catches are not permitted in Viperball. All kicked balls remain live until downed or out of bounds.

### Out of Bounds

If a kickoff goes out of bounds:
- Before reaching the receiving team's 20-yard line: receiving team takes possession at their 35-yard line
- Beyond the receiving team's 20-yard line: receiving team takes possession at the point where it went out of bounds

### Touchback

A kickoff into the end zone may be:
- Returned by the receiving team
- Downed for a touchback, resulting in possession at the receiving team's 25-yard line

---

## 9. Tackling & Blocking

### Tackling

- Rugby-style wrap tackling permitted
- No targeting of head or neck
- Dangerous contact penalized

### Blocking

- Open-field blocking allowed
- Blindside blocks restricted
- No wedge formations

---

## 10. Fumbles & Possession

- Live ball on fumble
- Any player may recover
- Ball remains live after kicks unless ruled dead

---

## 11. Turnover Mechanics

### Intent

Clear rules govern how possession changes, particularly involving kicks, fumbles, and laterals in this no-forward-pass game.

### Kicked Ball Recovery

- Any kicked ball that travels beyond the line of scrimmage may be recovered by either team
- The kicking team may advance a recovered kick
- The receiving team may advance any recovered kick
- A kicked ball that does not cross the line of scrimmage may only be recovered by the kicking team

### Muffed Kicks

- A muffed kick (touched but not possessed by the receiving team) remains live
- Either team may recover and advance a muffed kick
- There is no distinction between muffed punts and muffed kickoffs—all remain live

### Lateral Interceptions

- A lateral pass intercepted by the defense may be advanced
- An incomplete lateral (touching the ground) results in a fumble situation
- Any player may recover a loose lateral

### Turnover on Downs

- Failure to gain 20 yards in 5 downs results in immediate change of possession
- The opposing team takes possession at the spot where the ball was declared dead on the final down
- No "punt on 4th down" exemption exists, though teams may elect to kick strategically before the final down

---

## 12. Out of Bounds

- Ball carrier out of bounds results in dead ball
- Kicked ball out of bounds results in possession at exit spot

---

## 12A. Dead Ball and Live Ball Edge Cases

### Intent

Edge cases define how unusual situations are handled to ensure consistent rulings and fair play.

### Ball Hitting Overhead Structures

If the ball strikes the scoreboard, overhead structure, roof (in domed stadiums), or any non-field object suspended above the playing surface:
- The ball is immediately **dead**
- The down is **replayed from the previous spot**
- No yardage is gained or lost

### Ball Hitting an Official

If the ball strikes an official during live play:
- The ball **remains live**
- The official is considered part of the field
- Play continues as normal

### Inadvertent Whistle

If an official inadvertently blows the whistle during a live play:
- The ball is **dead immediately** at the spot when the whistle sounds
- The offensive team (team in possession before the play began) may choose to:
  1. **Replay the down** from the original spot, or
  2. **Accept the result** at the time of the whistle (yardage gained/lost up to the whistle)

### Simultaneous Possession

If two opposing players gain simultaneous possession of a live ball (not a kick):
- Possession is awarded to the **offense** (the team that had possession before the play began)
- On a loose ball or fumble, the team that last had clear possession is considered the offense

---

## 13. Field Dimensions & Markings

### Field Length and Width

- Total length: 120 yards (100-yard playing field plus two 10-yard end zones)
- Width: 53⅓ yards (160 feet)

### End Zones

- Depth: 10 yards each
- Goal line marks the boundary between end zone and playing field

### Yard Lines

- Exception: Medical personnel may enter with referee permission for injured players

**Media and Personnel:**
- Media, team staff, and other personnel must remain behind the designated media line
- Typically positioned 10-15 feet behind the team bench area

---

## 14. Clock Management

### Intent

Clock management creates strategic decisions about tempo, timeouts, and game flow.

### Running Clock

- Clock runs continuously during the first and third quarters
- Clock runs continuously during the first 10-13 minutes of the second and fourth quarters (depending on quarter length)

### Clock Stoppages

The clock stops for:
- Timeouts
- Scores (touchdown, field goal, safety)
- End of quarter
- Penalties (at referee's discretion)
- Injuries
- Out of bounds (final 2 minutes of each half only)
- Incomplete lateral that goes out of bounds (final 2 minutes of each half only)
- Change of possession (final 2 minutes of each half only)
- First downs (final 2 minutes of each half only)

### Timeouts

- Each team receives 3 timeouts per half
- Timeouts do not carry over between halves
- Each timeout lasts 90 seconds
- A timeout may be used to prevent an imminent delay of game penalty
- Timeouts may not be called after a scoring play (the clock is already stopped)
- Timeouts used for coach's challenges are consumed if the challenge fails; returned if it succeeds (see §24 Review System)

### Injury Timeout Protocol

**Clock Stoppage:**
- The clock stops immediately when an official identifies an injured player on the field
- Play is halted to allow medical personnel to attend to the player

**Player Removal Requirement:**
- An injured player must leave the field for at least **one play** before returning
- Exception: If the injury occurs during the **final two minutes of a half**, the injured player's team is **charged a timeout**

**Timeout Charges:**
- The team is **not charged a timeout** for injury stoppages that occur outside the final two minutes of either half
- If a team has **no remaining timeouts** and an injury occurs in the final two minutes, the **opposing team is awarded a free timeout** as compensation for the stoppage

**Concussion Protocol:**
- Players removed under concussion protocol may not return to the same game (see §25 Player Safety for full protocol)

### Two-Minute Warning

- Official timeout at the 2:00 mark of the second and fourth quarters
- Clock begins on referee's signal after the two-minute warning

### Play Clock

- 40 seconds from the end of the previous play
- 25 seconds after administrative stoppages, timeouts, and penalties
- Visible on stadium clock or field display

### Delay of Game

- Failure to snap before play clock expires results in a 5-yard penalty
- Repeated delay of game infractions may result in unsportsmanlike conduct penalties

### Final Play

- If time expires during a live play, the play continues until the ball is ruled dead
- Untimed downs are awarded if defensive penalties occur on the final play of a half

---

## 15. Players on the Field

Each team shall field eleven players. No more than eleven players may participate in play at any time. A team must have no fewer than nine players on the field to continue play. If a team falls below nine players, the referee may suspend play until the number is restored. Violation of player count results in a penalty for illegal substitution or too many players on the field.

---

## 16. Offensive Positions

### Intent

Offensive formations balance structure with tactical flexibility. Positional requirements ensure competitive alignment while allowing creative play design.

### Rules

At the snap, the offensive team shall satisfy positional distribution requirements for legal formation. Positional titles exist for alignment and enforcement only and do not restrict movement once the ball is live.

### Linemen

Five players shall be designated as Linemen at the snap. Linemen must align within one yard of the line of scrimmage and between the outermost offensive players. Linemen may advance, lateral, receive laterals, and kick once the ball is live. Linemen are eligible to recover all live balls. Linemen provide the foundation for both blocking schemes and quick lateral distribution in open play.

#### Linemen Archetypes

| Archetype | Primary Strength | Team Fit |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Maulers** | Run blocking dominance | Power-based rushing attack |
| **Screens** | Screen blocking & mobility | Lateral-heavy offense |
| **Hybrids** | Balanced blocking | Versatile play-calling |

#### Line Unit Ratings

| Metric | Elite | Good | Average | Below Average |
|--------|-------|------|---------|---------------|
| **Run Block Grade** | 85+ | 75-84 | 65-74 | <65 |
| **Screen Block Grade** | 80+ | 70-79 | 60-69 | <60 |
| **Kick Protection Grade** | 85+ | 75-84 | 65-74 | <65 |
| **Blown Assignments/Game** | <1.0 | 1.0-2.0 | 2.0-3.5 | >3.5 |

### Zeroback

Each offensive formation must include one Zeroback. The Zeroback is the primary distributor and may receive the snap directly. The Zeroback may run, lateral, or kick at any time. A different player may receive the snap, but the Zeroback designation must still be present on the field. The Zeroback serves as the offensive quarterback equivalent, orchestrating plays and making critical tactical decisions in real time.

#### Zeroback Archetypes

| Archetype | Primary Threat | Secondary Threat | Playstyle |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Kicking ZB** | Drop-kick accuracy | Field position control | Calculated field management, dominant kicking threat |
| **Running ZB** | Ground rushing | Lateral distribution | Dual-threat mobility, pressure through rushing lanes |
| **Distributor ZB** | Lateral precision | Vision & spacing | Traditional field general, controlled possession |
| **Dual-Threat ZB** | Balanced run/kick | Versatile playmaking | Dynamic threat requiring defensive commitment |

#### Statistical Targets by Archetype

| Archetype | Touches/Game | Rush Yards/Game | Yards/Carry | Laterals Thrown/Game | Snapkick Attempts/Game | Snapkick Accuracy | TDs/Game | Team TD Involvement |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|

#### Defensive Adjustments by Archetype

| Archetype | Defensive Priority | Coverage Adjustments | Personnel Considerations |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Kicking ZB** | Kick rush pressure | Deep safety positioning | Extra return coverage depth |
| **Running ZB** | Contain rushing lanes | Spotback gap discipline | Additional box defenders |
| **Distributor ZB** | Lateral lane coverage | Deny lateral windows | Quick-reaction defenders |
| **Dual-Threat ZB** | Balanced gap/kick defense | Flexible safety positioning | Versatile defensive backs |

### Flankers (Halfback, Left Wingback, Right Wingback, Shiftback)

The Flankers are the primary ball-carriers and versatile playmakers in the offensive backfield. Four flanker positions must be present at the snap:

**Halfback (HB):** One Halfback must be present. The Halfback may receive handoffs, laterals, or kicks and may kick in open play.

**Wingbacks (LW/RW):** One Left Wingback (LW) and one Right Wingback (RW) must be present at the snap. Wingbacks must align outside the interior formation.

**Shiftback (SB):** One Shiftback shall be designated at the snap. The Shiftback aligns between the interior and perimeter and may block, run, lateral, receive kicks, or defend. The Shiftback may shift position prior to the snap provided the minimum offensive structure remains intact. The Shiftback creates unpredictability, shifting based on defensive alignment and exploiting mismatches.

#### Position-Specific Roles

| Position | Alignment | Primary Role | Secondary Role |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Halfback** | Central backfield | Primary ball-carrier | Lateral receiver |
| **Left Wingback** | Outside left | Perimeter runner | Blocking support |
| **Right Wingback** | Outside right | Perimeter runner | Blocking support |
| **Shiftback** | Flexible positioning | Mismatch creator | Versatile playmaker |

| **Elusive Flanker** | ★★★★☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ |
| **Reliable Flanker** | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ |

### Viper

One Viper shall be designated at the snap. The Viper is alignment-exempt and may position freely at any depth or width. The Viper shall wear a jersey of a distinctly different color from the rest of the team. The Viper serves as a wild card, capable of deep positioning for kick returns, motion-based misdirection, or surprise rushing angles. The distinct jersey allows officials and opponents to track the Viper's unique status.

#### Viper Archetypes

| Archetype | Primary Threat | Secondary Threat | Playstyle |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Receiving Viper** | Lateral reception | Space exploitation | High-touch playmaker in open field |
| **Power Viper** | Physical rushing | Short-yardage conversion | Bruising runner, mismatch creator |
| **Decoy Viper** | Pre-snap manipulation | Alignment confusion | Strategic positioning, defensive disruption |
| **Hybrid Viper** | Balanced versatility | Unpredictable usage | Multi-dimensional threat |

#### Statistical Targets by Archetype

## 17. Defensive Positions

### Intent

Defensive formations provide structure to counter offensive tactics while maintaining flexibility for kick coverage and pursuit.

### Rules

At the snap, the defensive team shall satisfy positional distribution requirements for legal formation. Positional titles exist for alignment and enforcement only and do not restrict movement once the ball is live.

### Line Anchors

Three players shall be designated as Line Anchors at the snap: Left Guard, Nose, and Right Guard. Line Anchors must align within one yard of the line of scrimmage. Left Guard and Right Guard provide front line pressure. The Nose serves as the central anchor point. These players disrupt offensive blocking schemes and pursue ball carriers in the backfield.

## 19. Snap Rules

### Intent

The snap initiates each play and must follow consistent mechanics to ensure fair play and prevent false starts.

### Legal Snap

- The snap must be a continuous motion backward from the line of scrimmage
- The ball must be snapped to a player positioned at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage, or laterally to a player on the line
- The center (middle lineman) executes the snap
- All other offensive players must be set for at least one second before the snap (except one player in legal motion)

### Snap Recipient

- The Zeroback typically receives the snap but is not required to do so
- Any offensive player positioned legally may receive the snap
- The snap may be direct (handed) or thrown backward

### False Start

A false start occurs when:
- An offensive player moves after being set and before the snap
- The exception is one player in legal lateral or backward motion
- Penalty: 5 yards, replay of down

### Encroachment and Offside

- **Encroachment:** A defensive player makes contact with an offensive player before the snap. Penalty: 5 yards, automatic first down.
- **Offside:** A player is on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped. Penalty: 5 yards.

### Neutral Zone Infractions

**Neutral Zone Infraction:**
- A defensive player enters the neutral zone (the space between the two lines of scrimmage defined by the length of the ball) before the snap **and causes an offensive player to react** (move, flinch, or commit a false start)
- This is a **dead ball foul** — the play is immediately stopped
- **Penalty:** 5 yards, enforced against the defense

**Disconcerting Signals:**
- Defensive players may not use **signals, words, or cadences** designed to simulate the offense's snap count or cadence
- This includes mimicking the Zeroback's voice or using fake snap counts to draw the offense offside
- **Penalty:** 5 yards, dead ball foul, enforced against the defense

**Distinction from Encroachment:**
- Encroachment requires physical contact with an offensive player
- Neutral zone infraction requires entering the neutral zone and causing a reaction, but not necessarily contact

### Dead Ball Fouls Before Snap

Any foul committed before the snap results in a dead ball foul:
- False start (offense)
- Encroachment (defense)
- Neutral zone infraction (defense)
- Disconcerting signals (defense)
- Illegal formation
- Delay of game

---

## 20. Illegal Formation

- Fewer than five offensive Linemen on the line at the snap: five-yard penalty, replay of down
- Absence of a designated Zeroback: five-yard penalty, replay of down
- Fewer than the minimum required Wingbacks, Halfback, Shiftback, or Viper: five-yard penalty
- Defensive alignment violations: five-yard penalty enforced at the snap

---

## 21. Motion

One offensive player may be in motion at the snap provided that player is moving laterally or backward. No player may be in forward motion at the snap.

---

## 22. Positional Freedom After Snap

Once the ball is live, all players may move freely. Positional designations apply only at the moment of the snap for purposes of formation legality and officiating.

---

## 23. Penalties

### Intent

Penalties maintain fair play, player safety, and game integrity. Officials enforce penalties consistently to ensure competitive balance.

### Penalty Table

| Infraction | Penalty | Enforcement |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Forward Pass Violation** | Loss of down + 5 yards | From spot of pass |
| **Illegal Offensive Formation** | 5 yards | Replay of down |
| **Illegal Defensive Formation** | 5 yards | Enforced at snap |
| **Targeting Head/Neck** | 15 yards + ejection | From spot of foul |
| **Blindside Block** | 15 yards | From spot of foul |
| **Too Many Players on Field** | 5 yards | Enforced at snap |
| **False Start** | 5 yards | Enforced at line of scrimmage |
| **Offside** | 5 yards | Enforced at line of scrimmage |
| **Encroachment** | 5 yards + automatic first down | Enforced at line of scrimmage |
| **Neutral Zone Infraction** | 5 yards | Dead ball foul, enforced at line of scrimmage |
| **Disconcerting Signals** | 5 yards | Dead ball foul, enforced at line of scrimmage |
| **Delay of Game** | 5 yards | Enforced at line of scrimmage |
| **Unsportsmanlike Conduct** | 15 yards | From spot of foul or previous spot |
| **Sideline Interference** | 15 yards (unsportsmanlike) | From previous spot |
| **Illegal Motion** | 5 yards | Enforced at snap |
| **Offensive Holding** | 10 yards | From spot of foul |
| **Defensive Holding** | 5 yards + automatic first down | From spot of foul |
| **Wedge Formation (3+ players)** | 15 yards | From spot of foul |
| **Illegal Kick** | 5 yards | From spot of kick |
| **Illegal Substitution** | 5 yards | Enforced at snap |
| **Face Mask** | 15 yards | From spot of foul |
| **Clipping** | 15 yards | From spot of foul |
| **Unnecessary Roughness** | 15 yards | From spot of foul |
| **Pass Interference** | Not applicable (no forward passes) | N/A |
| **Intentional Grounding** | Not applicable (no forward passes) | N/A |

### Notes

- Dead ball fouls are enforced before the next snap
- Live ball fouls may be accepted or declined by the non-offending team
- Multiple fouls on the same play: accepting team chooses which penalty to enforce
- Personal fouls (targeting, unnecessary roughness, unsportsmanlike conduct) may result in ejection at referee's discretion

---

## 24. Officials & Enforcement

### Number and Roles

A complete officiating crew consists of **seven officials**:

1. **Referee (R):** Overall game authority, positioned behind the offensive backfield. Signals penalties, communicates with team captains, and makes final rulings on disputed calls.

2. **Umpire (U):** Positioned behind the defensive line. Monitors line play, illegal blocks, and equipment violations.

3. **Head Linesman (HL):** Positioned on one sideline at the line of scrimmage. Monitors offside, encroachment, and out-of-bounds on their sideline. Manages the chain crew.

4. **Line Judge (LJ):** Positioned opposite the Head Linesman. Mirrors HL responsibilities on the opposite sideline. Monitors the play clock.

5. **Field Judge (FJ):** Positioned deep downfield behind the defense. Monitors kicks, deep coverage, and scoring plays.

6. **Side Judge (SJ):** Positioned deep on the sideline. Monitors kicks, counts defensive players, and watches for illegal formations.

7. **Back Judge (BJ):** Positioned deep in the defensive backfield. Monitors kick coverage, tracks the Keeper position, and assists with field goal attempts.

### Penalty Signals and Enforcement

- Officials signal penalties using standard hand signals and verbal announcements
- Yellow flags mark the spot of infractions
- The Referee announces the penalty to both teams and the crowd
- Distance penalties are measured from the appropriate enforcement spot using the chain crew

### Acceptance and Declination

- The non-offending team's captain may accept or decline most live-ball penalties
- Dead-ball fouls and personal fouls are automatically enforced
- Penalties that result in first downs or loss of downs cannot be declined if they benefit the non-offending team

### Review System

- **Coach's Challenges:** Each team receives two challenges per game. A third challenge is awarded if the first two are successful. Challenges require a timeout.
- **Reviewable Plays:** Scoring plays, turnovers, spot of the ball, player down by contact, out-of-bounds, and certain penalties.
- **Automatic Reviews:** All scoring plays and turnovers are automatically reviewed regardless of game time (upgraded from final two minutes only).
- The Referee consults video replay and makes the final determination.

#### Replay Scope and Non-Reviewable Plays

**Reviewable:**
- Whether the ball crossed the goal line for a touchdown
- Whether a kick passed inside the uprights and above the crossbar (field goal attempts)
- Spot of the ball at the end of a play
- Whether a player was down by contact before a fumble
- Whether a player stepped out of bounds
- Whether a fumble occurred (but not who recovered it from a pile — see below)
- Targeting penalties (reviewable to confirm or overturn ejection)

**Non-Reviewable:**
- Penalties (except targeting)
- Player conduct and unsportsmanlike behavior
- Clock management decisions by officials
- Play clock expiration
- Whether an official's whistle blew before a turnover
- Fumble recovery: reviewable only to determine whether the ball was fumbled; the recovery itself (who emerged from a pile with possession) is not reviewable

### Chain Crew & Measurement Procedures

**Chain Crew Composition:**

The chain crew consists of three assistants managed by the Head Linesman:
1. **Box Operator:** Holds the down indicator showing the current down
2. **Rear Rod Holder:** Marks the beginning of the 20-yard requirement
3. **Forward Rod Holder:** Marks the end of the 20-yard requirement (first down line)

**Measurement Requests:**

- Either team's captain may request a measurement
- Officials may initiate measurements at their discretion
- The clock does not stop for measurements unless the measurement occurs in the final two minutes of a half

**Measurement Procedure:**

1. The chains are brought onto the field to the ball's position
2. The rear rod is placed at the original spot (marked by the chain crew)
3. The chain is extended toward the ball
4. If the ball reaches or passes the forward rod when fully extended, a new set of downs is awarded
5. If the ball does not reach the forward rod, the down count continues

### Officiating Mechanics for Kicks

**Judging Field Goal Attempts:**

- The **Field Judge (FJ)** and **Back Judge (BJ)** are jointly responsible for field goal rulings
- The ball must pass **entirely inside the uprights** and **above the crossbar** to be successful
- If the officials disagree, the Referee makes the final determination after consultation

**Simultaneous Recovery:**

- If two opposing players gain possession of a kicked ball simultaneously:
  - On punts and kickoffs: possession awarded to the **receiving team**
  - On failed field goal attempts: possession awarded to the **kicking team**

**Blocked Kick Procedures:**

- Officials rule the kick blocked at the point of contact with the blocking player
- The ball is live from the spot where it was blocked
- A blocked kick that does not cross the line of scrimmage on a field goal attempt may only be advanced by the kicking team

**Tipped Drop-Kicks:**

- A drop kick that is tipped or deflected by any player but still passes through the uprights counts as a successful field goal (5 points)
- The tip or deflection does not invalidate the score

---

## 25. Player Safety

### Intent

Player safety is paramount. Viperball emphasizes rugby-style tackling and restricts dangerous play to protect participants at all levels.

### Concussion Protocol

- Any player exhibiting signs of head injury must be immediately removed from play
- A medical professional must evaluate the player before they may return
- Players diagnosed with a concussion may not return to the same game
- Teams must follow league-mandated return-to-play protocols for concussed players

### Ejection Criteria

Players shall be ejected for:
- Targeting an opponent's head or neck area
- Fighting or throwing punches
- Repeated unsportsmanlike conduct (two unsportsmanlike penalties in one game)
- Intentionally dangerous play as determined by the Referee
- Leaving the bench during an on-field altercation

### Dangerous Play Definitions

**Targeting:** Leading with the crown of the helmet, launching into a defenseless player, or striking an opponent's head or neck area.

**Blindside Block:** A block delivered from outside the opponent's field of vision that makes forceful contact with the head, neck, or torso.

**Wedge Formation:** Three or more blockers grouped together in a coordinated blocking pattern on kickoffs or punts.

**Clipping:** Blocking an opponent below the waist from behind.

**Unnecessary Roughness:** Any act of excessive force beyond what is necessary to tackle or block.

### Equipment Safety Requirements

- **Helmets:** Strongly recommended for all competitive play; mandatory for organized leagues. Helmets must meet safety certification standards.
- **Mouthguards:** Mandatory for all players.
- **Pads:** Optional but recommended. Shoulder pads, rib pads, and thigh pads may be worn.
- **Footwear:** Cleats with detachable studs are permitted. Metal spikes are prohibited.
- **Viper Jersey:** The Viper must wear a distinctly colored jersey for identification purposes.

### League Obligations

- Leagues must provide certified athletic trainers or medical personnel at all games
- Emergency action plans must be established for serious injuries
- All coaches must complete certified tackling and safety training
- Leagues must maintain injury reporting and tracking systems

---

## 26. Overtime Rules

### Intent

Overtime provides a fair method to determine a winner when regulation ends in a tie. The format emphasizes kicking skills consistent with Viperball's core philosophy.

### Overtime Structure

**Coin Toss:**
- The Referee conducts a coin toss at midfield
- The visiting team calls the toss
- The winner chooses to kick or receive; the loser chooses the end of the field to defend

**Sudden Victory:**
- Overtime periods are sudden victory (first score wins)
- Each team is guaranteed one possession unless the receiving team scores a touchdown on the first possession

**Possession:**
- The receiving team starts at their own 25-yard line
- If the first possession results in a field goal, the opposing team receives one possession from their 25-yard line
- If the second team matches the field goal, play continues with alternating possessions

**Kicking Duel (Alternative Format):**
- Teams alternate drop-kick field goal attempts from increasing distances
- Start at the 25-yard line (35-yard attempt)
- Each successful kick moves to the next distance: 30, 35, 40, 45, 50+ yard lines
- First team to miss while the other succeeds loses
- If both teams remain tied after five rounds, sudden-death kicking continues

**Multiple Overtime Periods:**
- If neither team has scored after one overtime period (10 minutes), a second period begins
- After two overtime periods, the kicking duel format may be implemented
- Ties are permitted in regular season play at league discretion

**Timeouts:**
- Each team receives one timeout per overtime period
- Timeouts do not carry over between overtime periods

### Tie-Breaker Rules for League Standings

**Note:** This is a league operations guideline for determining standings when teams have identical win-loss records. These rules do not apply to individual game outcomes.

When multiple teams have identical records at the end of the regular season, standings are determined by the following tie-breakers in order:

1. **Head-to-head record:** Result of games played directly between the tied teams
2. **Division/conference record:** Win-loss record within the division or conference
3. **Point differential:** Total points scored minus total points allowed, **capped at ±25 per game** to prevent running up scores
4. **Micro-scoring differential:** Drop-kick field goals (5 points) minus place-kick field goals (3 points) — a secondary metric unique to Viperball that rewards kicking skill
5. **Coin toss:** Conducted by the league commissioner or designated official

---

## 27. Optional Variations

Leagues may experiment with:

- Substitution limits
- Clock rules
- Field-goal distance bonuses
- Overtime formats

---

## 29. Weather & Game Suspension

### Intent

Weather and safety protocols ensure player and spectator safety during adverse conditions while providing clear guidelines for game suspension and resumption.

### Lightning Protocol

**Detection and Suspension:**
- If lightning is detected within **8 miles** of the venue, play is suspended immediately
- Play may not resume until at least **30 minutes** have passed since the last detected lightning strike within the 8-mile radius
- Each subsequent strike within 8 miles resets the 30-minute countdown

**Shelter Requirements:**
- Players, coaches, officials, and staff must seek appropriate shelter (enclosed buildings or vehicles)
- Spectators are strongly encouraged to seek shelter

### Game Suspension Authority

The **Referee** has sole authority to suspend play for unsafe conditions, including but not limited to:
- Severe weather (lightning, heavy rain, high winds, snow, hail)
- Dangerous field conditions (flooding, ice, structural damage)
- Power failure affecting lighting or critical stadium systems
- Any condition deemed hazardous to player or spectator safety

### Game Resumption

**Resumption Procedure:**
- A suspended game resumes from the **exact point of suspension**
- The down, distance, field position, score, time remaining, and timeouts are preserved
- Teams return to their respective sidelines as they were at the time of suspension

**Timeline:**
- The Referee determines when conditions are safe to resume play
- Teams are given a reasonable warm-up period (typically 10-15 minutes) before resumption

### Incomplete Games

If a game cannot be completed due to weather or other factors:
- **League rules govern** whether the game is:
  1. **Replayed** in its entirety at a later date
  2. **Resumed** from the point of suspension at a later date
  3. **Decided** by the score at the time of suspension (if sufficient game time has elapsed)
  4. **Forfeited** under specific league-defined circumstances
- The decision is made by the league commissioner or governing body, not game officials

---

## 30. Roster Rules

### Intent

Roster rules establish team composition requirements and ensure fair play through standardized roster management. These rules balance competitive depth with the two-way player philosophy central to Viperball.

### Active Game-Day Roster

- **Active roster size:** 36 players
- All active players are eligible to participate in the game
- The roster must be submitted to officials 60 minutes before kickoff

### Inactive List

- Teams may designate up to **8 players as inactive** before each game
- Inactive players may not dress or participate in any capacity
- Inactive designations must be communicated to officials before the pre-game roster submission deadline

### Emergency Substitutions

- If a team falls below **11 active players** due to injury or ejection during the game, they may activate **one inactive player** with referee approval
- Only one emergency activation is permitted per game
- The activated player must be ready to play within a reasonable time as determined by the Referee

### Player Designations

- **No designated specialists:** All players are expected to contribute in multiple roles and play both offense and defense as needed
- **Viper designation:** The Viper role may be assigned to any active player and may change during the game at dead-ball stoppages
- **Keeper designation:** The Keeper role may be assigned to any active player and may change during the game at dead-ball stoppages

### Roster Compliance

- Teams failing to submit rosters on time may face administrative penalties as determined by league rules
- Playing an ineligible or inactive player results in forfeiture of the game

## 31. Glossary

**Canadian Football (Ball):** The official game ball for Viperball. A Canadian football (CFL-spec) with specific dimensions: 12⅞ to 13⅛ inches (short axis circumference), 27¾ to 28¼ inches (long axis circumference), 14 to 15 ounces weight, leather or approved composite material, inflated to 12.5 to 13.5 psi. The slightly rounder shape compared to an American football supports drop-kick accuracy and bounce predictability.

**Coaching Box:** The designated area extending from the 25-yard line to the 25-yard line on each team's sideline, positioned 6 feet from the sideline boundary. No more than 3 coaches may stand in the coaching box during play.

**Cornerback:** One of two defensive players positioned wide to cover the perimeter and defend against sweeps and outside runs.

**Disconcerting Signals:** An illegal defensive tactic where players use signals, words, or cadences designed to simulate the offense's snap count. Results in a 5-yard penalty (dead ball foul).

**Drop Kick:** A kick executed by dropping the ball and kicking it immediately after it bounces off the ground. Worth 5 points when successfully kicked through the uprights.

**Edge Defender:** One of two defensive players positioned outside the Line Anchors, responsible for containing the edge and pursuing ball carriers.

**Halfback:** An offensive player who serves as a primary ball carrier. Must be present in every offensive formation.

**Inadvertent Whistle:** An official's whistle blown during a live play by mistake. The ball is dead immediately; the offense may choose to replay the down or accept the result at the time of the whistle.

**Keeper:** The deepest defensive player, responsible for fielding missed field goals, serving as the last line of defense, and defending against deep kicks.

**Lastback:** A defensive player positioned deep in the secondary, just in front of the Keeper. Provides run support and coverage against deep plays.

**Lateral:** A backward or sideways pass. Laterals may be thrown at any time and remain live if they touch the ground.

**Line Anchor:** One of three defensive linemen (Left Guard, Nose, Right Guard) who must align within one yard of the line of scrimmage and provide the foundation of the defensive front.

**Neutral Zone:** The space between the two lines of scrimmage, defined by the length of the football. Only the center (snapper) may be in the neutral zone before the snap.

**Neutral Zone Infraction:** A defensive player enters the neutral zone before the snap and causes an offensive player to react. Results in a 5-yard penalty (dead ball foul).

**Shiftback:** An offensive player who aligns between the interior and perimeter and may shift position before the snap to create tactical advantages.

**Spotback:** One of two defensive players positioned behind the Line Anchors, responsible for filling gaps and pursuing ball carriers.

**Viper:** A uniquely designated offensive player who is alignment-exempt and wears a distinctly colored jersey. The Viper may position freely anywhere on the field and serves as a tactical wild card.

**Wedge Formation:** An illegal formation where three or more blockers group together in a coordinated pattern. Prohibited due to safety concerns.

**Wingback:** One of two offensive players (Left Wingback and Right Wingback) who must align outside the interior formation and provide perimeter blocking and receiving options.

**Zeroback:** The primary offensive distributor, similar to a quarterback in traditional football. The Zeroback orchestrates plays and makes tactical decisions. Must be present in every offensive formation.
