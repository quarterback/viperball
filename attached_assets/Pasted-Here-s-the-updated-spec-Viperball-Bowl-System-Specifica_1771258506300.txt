Here's the updated spec:

# Viperball Bowl System Specification

## Overview

The postseason consists of two components: a **configurable playoff** (4, 8, 12, or 16 teams) for the championship and a **bowl system** for remaining eligible teams. Bowls reward regular season success and ensure competitive teams get a postseason game even if they miss the playoff.

---

## Playoff and Bowl Relationship

The playoff and bowl system are separate but connected:

1. **Playoff teams are selected first** (top 4, 8, 12, or 16 teams)
2. **Playoff teams are excluded from bowls** — they're competing for the championship
3. **Remaining eligible teams fill the bowl pool**

This means larger playoffs leave fewer teams for bowls, and smaller playoffs create a deeper bowl field.

---

## Bowl Eligibility

### Primary Rule
Teams with a **.500 or better record** are bowl-eligible.

| Regular Season Games | Bowl-Eligible Record |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 8 games | 4-4 or better |
| 10 games | 5-5 or better |
| 12 games | 6-6 or better |

### Pool Filling Rule
If there aren't enough .500+ teams to fill all bowl slots after removing playoff teams, add sub-.500 teams in order of record until all bowls are filled.

**Example:** 6 bowls (12 teams needed), 8-team playoff removes top 8
- 10 remaining teams are .500+
- Add the 2 best sub-.500 teams to reach 12

### Minimum Threshold
If even after adding sub-.500 teams there aren't enough to fill bowls, reduce bowl count to match available teams. A bowl requires 2 teams.

---

## Bowl Count Configuration

### Recommended Defaults by League Size and Playoff Size

| League Size | 4-Team Playoff | 8-Team Playoff | 12-Team Playoff | 16-Team Playoff |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 16–24 teams | 4 bowls (8) | 2 bowls (4) | 1 bowl (2) | 0 bowls |
| 25–40 teams | 6 bowls (12) | 4 bowls (8) | 3 bowls (6) | 2 bowls (4) |
| 41–60 teams | 8 bowls (16) | 6 bowls (12) | 5 bowls (10) | 4 bowls (8) |
| 61–80 teams | 10 bowls (20) | 8 bowls (16) | 6 bowls (12) | 5 bowls (10) |
| 81–100 teams | 12 bowls (24) | 10 bowls (20) | 8 bowls (16) | 6 bowls (12) |

*(Numbers in parentheses = teams in bowls)*

### User Override
Allow manual bowl count setting (0–16 range). The system should warn if:
- Bowl count exceeds available eligible teams
- Bowl count + playoff teams exceeds league size

---

## Bowl Tiering and Matchup Logic

### Core Principle
**Bowls match similar teams together.** An 11-1 team should not play a 5-7 team.

### Matchup Algorithm

```
1. Select playoff teams (4, 8, 12, or 16)
2. Remove playoff teams from bowl pool
3. Rank remaining teams by:
   a. Win percentage (primary)
   b. Point differential (tiebreaker)
   c. Head-to-head if applicable
4. Check eligibility:
   a. Count .500+ teams
   b. If count < (bowl_count × 2), add best sub-.500 teams
5. Pair teams by rank:
   - Bowl 1 (Tier 1): #1 vs #2
   - Bowl 2 (Tier 1): #3 vs #4
   - Bowl 3 (Tier 2): #5 vs #6
   - Continue until all bowls filled
6. Optional: Apply conference balancing (avoid same-conference matchups)
```

### Matchup Quality Guardrails

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Max win differential | 3 games (e.g., 9-3 can play 7-5, but not 5-7) |
| Same conference | Avoid if possible; swap with next-closest team |
| Regular season rematch | Allowed but deprioritized |

If guardrails can't be satisfied (small league, limited pool), override and create best available matchup.

### Tiering

| Tier | Bowl Position | Typical Records |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Tier 1 (Premier) | Bowls 1–2 | 8+ wins |
| Tier 2 (Major) | Bowls 3–4 | 6–8 wins |
| Tier 3 (Standard) | Bowls 5+ | 5–7 wins |

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario A: 32-Team League, 4-Team Playoff, 6 Bowls

```
Regular Season Results:
- 4 teams: 10-2 or better → PLAYOFF
- 8 teams: 7-5 to 9-3 → Bowl eligible (Tier 1-2)
- 6 teams: 5-7 to 6-6 → Bowl eligible (Tier 3)
- 14 teams: Below 5-7 → Not eligible

Bowl Pool (after removing playoff teams): 14 eligible
Need: 12 teams for 6 bowls

Bowl 1: #1 (9-3) vs #2 (9-3)
Bowl 2: #3 (8-4) vs #4 (8-4)
Bowl 3: #5 (7-5) vs #6 (7-5)
Bowl 4: #7 (7-5) vs #8 (6-6)
Bowl 5: #9 (6-6) vs #10 (6-6)
Bowl 6: #11 (5-7) vs #12 (5-7)
```

### Scenario B: 24-Team League, 12-Team Playoff, 2 Bowls

```
Regular Season Results:
- 12 teams selected for playoff
- Remaining: 12 teams

Bowl Pool: 12 teams (but many may be sub-.500)
- 4 teams: 5-7 or better → Bowl eligible
- 8 teams: Below .500 → Added to fill if needed

Bowl 1: #1 (6-6) vs #2 (6-6)
Bowl 2: #3 (5-7) vs #4 (5-7)
```

### Scenario C: 40-Team League, 16-Team Playoff, 4 Bowls

```
Regular Season Results:
- 16 teams in playoff
- Remaining: 24 teams

Bowl Pool after playoff exclusion:
- 10 teams: .500+ 
- Need 8 for 4 bowls → Top 8 selected

Bowl 1: #1 (7-5) vs #2 (7-5)
Bowl 2: #3 (6-6) vs #4 (6-6)
Bowl 3: #5 (6-6) vs #6 (6-6)
Bowl 4: #7 (5-7) vs #8 (5-7)
```

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| League size ≤ playoff size | No bowls possible; playoff only |
| All remaining teams sub-.500 | Fill bowls with best available; tier as "Consolation" |
| Odd number of eligible teams | Last team out misses bowl (or add one more sub-.500) |
| Not enough teams for configured bowls | Reduce bowl count automatically; notify user |
| 16-team playoff in 20-team league | Only 4 teams remain; max 2 bowls possible |
| User sets 0 bowls | Valid; playoff only, no bowl games |

---

## Bowl Name Defaults

Provide a default set that scales with bowl count:

| Bowl # | Default Name |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Viper Bowl |
| 2 | Snapkick Classic |
| 3 | Lateral Challenge |
| 4 | Territory Bowl |
| 5 | Chain Reaction Bowl |
| 6 | Keeper's Cup |
| 7 | Zeroback Showdown |
| 8 | Flanker Bowl |
| 9 | Gridiron Classic |
| 10 | Endzone Invitational |
| 11 | Pindown Bowl |
| 12 | Bell Bowl |

Allow user renaming in Dynasty Mode.
