You're right. That's a fundamental design flaw. In real football—and in the sports Viperball draws from—fumbles happen on any carry. Limiting fumbles to lateral chains creates two problems:

1. **It makes lateral chains feel punishing** — Players learn that chains = fumble risk, runs = safe. That discourages the signature mechanic of the sport.

2. **It's unrealistic** — Ball carriers fumble on runs, sweeps, dives, kick returns, and scrambles. Stripping the ball is a core defensive skill.

## Proposed Fumble Model

### Fumble Opportunities by Play Type

| Play Type | Can Fumble? | Base Rate | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Inside run (dive) | Yes | 1.5–2.5% | Lower risk, ball secured |
| Outside run (sweep/option) | Yes | 2–3% | More exposure, arm tackles |
| Lateral chain | Yes | 2–3% per exchange | Each lateral is a fumble opportunity |
| Punt return | Yes | 2–4% | Catching + running in traffic |
| Kick return (missed FG) | Yes | 2–3% | Keeper fielding and returning |
| Scramble (ZB) | Yes | 2–3% | Loose carry while improvising |
| Designed kick play | No | — | Ball is kicked, not carried |
| Punt (kicking team) | No | — | But can be blocked/muffed |

### Fumble Probability Factors

**Base rate by play type** (see above)

**Modifiers:**
- **Ball carrier Power attribute:** High power = better ball security (−20% to −30%)
- **Ball carrier fatigue:** Below 70% stamina = +2–3%
- **Defensive scheme:** Pressure/Blitz = +1–2% (more hits)
- **Tackle type:** Standard tackle = base rate; big hit/TFL = +3–5%
- **Weather (if implemented):** Rain/snow = +2–3%

**Lateral chain specific:**
- Each exchange has its own fumble check (2–3% per lateral)
- Chain length of 4 = roughly 8–12% cumulative chance across all exchanges
- This is higher than a single run, which is the tradeoff for higher expected yards

## Example Fumble Rates Per Game (Target)

| Play Type | Plays/Game | Fumble Rate | Expected Fumbles |
|-----------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Runs (all types) | 35–45 | 2% | 0.7–0.9 |
| Lateral chains | 15–20 | 6–8% cumulative | 1.0–1.6 |
| Punt returns | 4–6 | 3% | 0.1–0.2 |
| Kick returns | 1–2 | 2.5% | 0.02–0.05 |
| **Total per team** | — | — | **1.8–2.7** |

**Both teams combined:** 3.5–5.5 fumbles per game (not all lost—~50% recovery rate)
**Fumbles lost per team:** ~1–1.5 per game

This matches the calibration target of 4–6 total fumbles per game with 2–3 changing possession.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Add fumble check to run plays

```python
def simulate_run(self, family: PlayFamily) -> Play:
    # ... existing run logic ...
    
    # Fumble check for ball carrier
    base_fumble_prob = 0.02  # 2% base for runs
    
    # Adjust by play type
    if family == PlayFamily.DIVE_OPTION:
        base_fumble_prob = 0.015  # Inside runs safer
    elif family in [PlayFamily.SWEEP_OPTION, PlayFamily.SPEED_OPTION]:
        base_fumble_prob = 0.025  # Outside runs riskier
    
    # Modify by carrier attributes
    carrier = self.get_ball_carrier()
    if carrier.power >= 80:
        base_fumble_prob *= 0.75  # Strong carriers hold on
    
    # Modify by fatigue
    if carrier.stamina < 70:
        base_fumble_prob += 0.025
    
    # Modify by defensive pressure
    defense = self._current_defense()
    if defense.get("style") == "pressure":
        base_fumble_prob += 0.015
    
    # Big hit check (TFL or loss of yards)
    if yards_gained <= 0:
        base_fumble_prob += 0.03  # Stuffed at line = harder hit
    
    # Fumble roll
    if random.random() < base_fumble_prob:
        return self._create_fumble_play(...)
```

### 2. Add fumble check to returns

```python
def simulate_punt_return(self) -> Play:
    # ... existing return logic ...
    
    # Muff chance on catch
    muff_prob = 0.02
    if weather == "rain":
        muff_prob += 0.02
    
    if random.random() < muff_prob:
        return self._create_muff_play(...)
    
    # Fumble during return
    fumble_prob = 0.03
    # ... modifiers ...
    
    if random.random() < fumble_prob:
        return self._create_fumble_play(...)
```

### 3. Rebalance lateral chain fumbles

Since runs now have fumble risk, lateral chains should feel like a calculated gamble—higher ceiling, higher floor—not the *only* source of turnovers.

```python
# Per-exchange fumble rate (not per-chain)
exchange_fumble_prob = 0.025  # 2.5% per lateral

# 3-lateral chain = 3 checks at 2.5% each
# Cumulative: 1 - (0.975)^3 = 7.3% chance of fumble somewhere in chain
```

This makes a 3-lateral chain roughly 3× riskier than a single run (7% vs 2%), which feels right given the higher expected yardage.

## Summary for Engineer

**Current state:** Only lateral chains can fumble → chains feel punishing, runs feel artificially safe

**Fix:** Add fumble probability to all ball-carrying plays:
- Runs: 1.5–2.5% base
- Lateral chains: 2–3% per exchange (cumulative)
- Returns: 2–4% base

**Result:** 
- Total fumbles per game: 4–6 (both teams)
- Fumbles lost per team: 1–1.5
- Lateral chains remain riskier than runs, but not the *only* risk
- Defensive pressure and ball carrier attributes matter across all plays
