You're right on both counts. Let me reframe:

---

## Problem 1: 6th Down Treated as Garbage Time

The sim treats 6th down like "oh shit we're out of options" instead of what it actually is: **a normal 4th down in football**.

**6-down Viperball maps to 4-down football like this:**

| Viperball | Football Equivalent | Decision |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|
| 1st–3rd down | 1st–2nd down | Run offense |
| 4th–5th down | 3rd down | Run offense, maybe get aggressive |
| 6th down | 4th down | Punt, kick FG, or go for it |

Right now the AI is treating 5th down like 4th down in football, which wastes an entire down. Teams should be running normal offense through 5th down and only making the punt/kick/go-for-it decision on 6th.

---

## Problem 2: "Lateral Chain" is Not the Only Offense

The sim has collapsed all ball-carrying into a false binary:

- **Lateral chain** = "passing game" equivalent
- **Everything else** = ???

But real Viperball offense would have the full playbook:

### Run Game (No Laterals)

| Play Type | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Dive | Straight ahead, behind center | Short yardage, clock kill |
| Sweep | Outside run, speed to edge | Space on perimeter |
| Power | Pulling guards, downhill | Goal line, need 2–3 yards |
| Option | ZB reads defender, keeps or pitches | Creates numbers advantage |
| Viper run | Give to Viper on jet motion | Mismatch exploitation |
| Draw | Fake kick/lateral, delayed handoff | Catch defense cheating |

### Lateral Game (1+ Laterals)

| Play Type | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Short chain (2 laterals) | Quick pitch sequence | Safe yards, move ball horizontally |
| Medium chain (3 laterals) | Extended ball movement | Spread defense, find seam |
| Long chain (4–5 laterals) | Full-field lateral attack | Explosive play hunting, risky |
| Screen lateral | Fake inside, lateral to perimeter | Defense crashing inside |
| Viper lateral | Get ball to Viper in space | Playmaker isolation |

### Kicking Game

| Play Type | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Snap kick | Live-ball drop kick for 5 pts | In range, want to score |
| Place kick | Set piece FG for 3 pts | 6th down, take the points |
| Punt | Field position | 6th down, out of FG range |
| Quick kick | Surprise punt on early down | Flip field, pin deep |

## Current Play Family Breakdown (From Your JSON)

```json
"play_family_breakdown": {
    "speed_option": 12,
    "lateral_spread": 16,
    "dive_option": 11,
    "territory_kick": 7,
    "sweep_option": 12,
    "none": 3
}
```

This actually looks decent—there's variety. But the issue is probably:

1. **Lateral chains are called when runs would be smarter** (short yardage, clock situations)
2. **The lateral/run decision doesn't consider game context**

## Fix: Offensive Play Selection by Situation

```python
def select_play_type(self):
    down = self.state.down
    ytg = self.state.yards_to_go
    fp = self.state.field_position
    time_remaining = self.state.time_remaining
    score_diff = self.get_score_differential()
    
    # === SHORT YARDAGE (1-3 yards to go) ===
    if ytg <= 3:
        # Favor power runs, dives — don't risk lateral fumble
        weights = {
            'dive_option': 0.40,
            'power_option': 0.30,
            'sweep_option': 0.15,
            'lateral_spread': 0.10,  # Low — don't need to risk it
            'snap_kick': 0.05,       # Only if in range
        }
    
    # === MEDIUM YARDAGE (4-10 yards) ===
    elif ytg <= 10:
        # Balanced attack
        weights = {
            'sweep_option': 0.25,
            'speed_option': 0.20,
            'lateral_spread': 0.25,
            'dive_option': 0.15,
            'option': 0.10,
            'snap_kick': 0.05,
        }
    
    # === LONG YARDAGE (11+ yards) ===
    else:
        # Need chunk play — laterals, speed
        weights = {
            'lateral_spread': 0.40,  # High risk/reward
            'speed_option': 0.25,
            'sweep_option': 0.20,
            'snap_kick': 0.10,       # Take the points if in range
            'dive_option': 0.05,     # Won't get 11+ on a dive
        }
    
    # === CLOCK MANAGEMENT ===
    if leading and time_remaining < 300:
        # Run the ball, avoid turnovers
        weights['lateral_spread'] *= 0.5
        weights['dive_option'] *= 1.5
        weights['sweep_option'] *= 1.3
    
    # === TRAILING LATE ===
    if trailing and time_remaining < 300:
        # Need big plays
        weights['lateral_spread'] *= 1.4
        weights['snap_kick'] *= 1.5
    
    # === RED ZONE ===
    if fp >= 80:
        # Tighter space, less room for laterals
        weights['dive_option'] *= 1.3
        weights['power_option'] *= 1.3
        weights['lateral_spread'] *= 0.7
    
    # === DOWN-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS ===
    if down <= 3:
        # Early downs — can take risks
        pass  # Use base weights
    
    elif down in [4, 5]:
        # Middle downs — still have cushion, but be smart
        if ytg <= 5:
            weights['dive_option'] *= 1.2  # Get the first down
    
    elif down == 6:
        # DECISION DOWN — like 4th down in football
        return self.select_6th_down_decision()  # Separate logic
    
    return weighted_choice(weights)
```

## Key Insight

The offense should feel like football with more options, not like a gimmick sport where every play is a lateral circus. Ground and pound should work. Clock management should exist. Short yardage should be dive/power, not a 4-lateral chain.

The lateral game is the *replacement for passing*, not the replacement for running.
