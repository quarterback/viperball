Yeah, explosive runs are core to the sport. In 7s and flag football, one broken tackle and you’re gone—there’s no cavalry coming. Same in Viperball.

Explosive Run Mechanics
Why Explosives Happen in Viperball
	1.	Fewer defenders — Like 7s, the field is spread thin
	2.	No deep safety help — Keeper is the last line, not a safety 15 yards back
	3.	Pursuit angles are longer — Defenders flow to ball, but laterals keep them guessing
	4.	One miss = gone — Beat the Keeper and it’s 6 (well, 9)

Explosive Rates by Play Type

|Power            |10%             |Downhill momentum can break tackles |
|Sweep            |18%             |Edge speed, open field              |

Sample Explosive Run Output

Q2 | 1st & 20 | Own 35

Play: Viper Jet — VP1 in motion, takes handoff

VP1 cuts upfield → 8 yards (beat first level)
    [EXPLOSIVE CHECK: 28% base + 8% speed + 6% elusiveness = 42%]
    [ROLL: 0.31 — EXPLOSIVE TRIGGERED]

VP1 breaks into open field — Keeper KP4 in pursuit
    [Remaining field: 57 yards]
    [TD chance: 45% base + 15% speed = 60%]
    [ROLL: 0.44 — TOUCHDOWN]

VP1 Viper Jet → 65 yards — TOUCHDOWN!


What This Creates
	∙	Home run threat on every snap — Defense can’t relax
	∙	Viper Jet and Counter are the “deep ball” — High-risk, high-reward
	∙	Dives are safe but capped — You’re not breaking one for 50
	∙	Keeper fatigue matters — Boot Raid teams wear down the Keeper, then gash them with Viper Jets late
	∙	Speed wins — Elite speed Flankers and Vipers have TD upside every touch
This matches 7s/flag football feel—most plays are 4-8 yards, but any touch can go the distance.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
